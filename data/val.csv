"stevia sweetener totally unnecessary. i overlooked the stevia in the ingredients, it's a bad combination to add this sweetener to the green powder honestly, it makes the juice taste artificially sweet like a sweet tart. i want my greens to taste like raw greens, why does it have to be sweet? very hard to drink in my opinion, i have to pinch my nose to get it down. i still give it three starts for over all quality of ingredients, but taste is horrible.",Color and texture
"contraindications about excessive folic acid intake during pregnancy (222%). ""x brand"" brand revly vegan prenatal multivitamin contains many vitamins that basic prenatals do not include. the american pregnancy association recommends a variety of vitamins and these vitamins are included in this formula. this formula does a few unusual things compared to other prenatal multivitamins. it has more thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, b6, b12, folate, chromium, pantothenic acid, and vitamin a. all of these vitamins are over 100% of the daily value in some of them are over 200% of the daily value.  the reason why i am opting out of taking two of these a day is that of the percent of folic acid in the formula. there is 222% of folic acid in the formula and experts are led to believe that sometimes too much folic acid is not good for the baby. there are several contraindications about taking an excess of 100% of the daily value on the health of the baby. the values in this formula do not coincide with the values recommended by the american pregnancy association.  i like that there is a probiotic blend and i also like that there is an organic sprout blend in the formula. there is an organic botanical blend as well.  this botanical blend contains some herbs that are not usually recommended during pregnancy.  these herbs are found in this formula as a powder and my assumption is that they are not potent enough to make a negative impact. some of the botanicals that are not recommended include peppermint leaf, lemon balm, lavender, and clove. these botanicals are considered uterine stimulants which are not recommended in pregnancy. i personally do not feel uncomfortable with these ingredients because they are at a low dose.  however, someone that is sensitive to these ingredients may want to be aware that they are in the formula.  the vitamin values in this formula are higher than usual and the herbs are slightly unusual for pregnancy.  this has not made me feel ill but i will not be taking it any longer during pregnancy but perhaps post pregnancy.",Not Effective

"good supplement, but pills are very large and ingredients label is unreadable.. this is a high quality multi vitamins for the ones who are extremely concerned about any artificial additives and absorbing excess levels of vitamins.  indeed, this is a very low multi-vitamin supplement.  most vitamins are at or below the 100% of daily value which many consider as a minimum for maintaining health.i give it a less than perfect rating for two reasons.  the first one is the label of supplement facts is just about unreadable.  that is really unacceptable and so easy to fix.  just use a descent font size and shape for that portion of your label.  the second reason is that the pills are huge.  that is probably the trade-off for such pills being so natural and pure.  however, any one who has issues with swallowing medium to large size pills will have to stay away from this supplement.  i think the first problem is easy for the company to resolve; meanwhile the second one is probably something that the customer has to be aware off when dealing with more natural supplements (they may be a bit bulkier).",Too big to swallow

"natures made prenatal gummies-sweet vitamin treat. nature made prenatal gummies are a supplemental gummy that are designed to provide extra vitamins to mom and growing baby all while being a sweet treat.  nature made prenatal gummies contains 7 grams of carbohydrates and 5 grams of sugar per two gummies. they may not be suitable for those on a low-carb low-sugar diet.  they have a sugary coating and are sweetened with sugar, glucose sugar, and sucrose.  my preference would be that they were sweetened with a healthy sugar substitute like stevia.  nature made prenatal gummies are unique because they contain a small amount of dha and epa. they are a rather large gummy and have a raspberry type of flavor.  the flavor is decent but it took me a bit to get used to the sweetness.  this gummy was easy on my stomach and was good as an after dinner treat.  this would be a good gummy for someone who gets daily sweet cravings.  i find that i could go without the sugar coating and that they would likely still be enjoyable all while being healthier. they also are missing a few of the recommended vitamins for pregnancy. those additional vitamins can be supplemented. this is a very basic formula that can be used as a supplementation to a woman's daily diet.  it is good for women who have had trouble with prenatals as it is not hard on the stomach.",Ingredients

"c-section flap shrinking by the inches. *received free bottle for review *i started with 1 pill 2 hours before meals for 3 days and then 3 pills before meals after that. i've found that it works better for me to eat between 30-45 minutes after taking them. after 3 weeks i noticed that i was averaging a loss of 1/2 pound per week and stomach fat reduction, not drastic just slight. i added intermittent fasting 16:8 and some days omad at the start of the 2nd bottle. eating lots of veggies and protein. exercise 5 days cardio and strength training. 1200-1500 calories or less some days.this regimen has me losing 3-4 lbs per week! i also take the pills during fasting hours and seems to work well. it doesn't suppress my appetite as in the first 2 weeks though. i think it just blocks the fat at this point.baby weight is coming off, c-section flap is shrinking but i honestly believe it is mostly due to intermittent fasting, diet changes and exercise.update: 6/18/19i've noticed in 2 weeks of no exercise and diet the pills did not work. i've researched and found that these are standardized to 60% hca and that may be why i'm not seeing any results from the pills on their own. i've found other brands that are made in usa standardized to 80-95% with 100% pure garcinia cambogia. i'll have to try another brand. this is my honest review.",Not Effective

"hypoallergenic, but room for improvement. my son has moderate eczema so i am wary of any products that contain a lot of allergens so i was super excited about these diapers. as far as the hypoallergenic aspect goes.. we have had no issues which makes these diapers a huge plus. they are really affordable compared to any other hypoallergenic diapers so i was hoping so desperately that these would be good, however after trying two boxes i have decided these just aren’t the best for us.pros:all white printgood for slimmer babies (may need to size up from name brand sizing if you have a super chunky babe)hypoallergenicaffordablecons:they shed, both the outside and the inside. when changing my sons diapers, i have to pull pieces off of his private parts. if you miss anything or if something is in a crevice, it can easily irritate the skin. they also shed on the outside making them look super tattered and raggedy.they sag a great deal with a small amount of urine.sizing is different from huggies or pampers ... they definitely run small. if your child is even remotely close to the upper end in weight, size up.i think these are great for immobile babies so the sagging isn’t as big of a deal, but anything beyond that i wouldn’t recommend.",Too big to swallow

"not a good monster replacement. i was excited to find a possible replacement for expensive monster drinks.  here are my findings after one case (solimno red).1) cans are weak, very cheap packaging. on day 1, as i pulled off the plastic wrap, one of the cans popped a pin hole and sprayed my entire office before i could get a trash can over it.  down to 23 cans on the first day. savings are now very minimal. (it stains)  do not knock these cans around. very thin can walls and crappy opener tabs.2) flavor is not good at all.  the various calorie free monster drinks have sharp and clean flavors with no after taste.  the solimo red tastes like artificial sweetener, and it leaves a long lasting after taste that is unpleasant.3) price is good.  basically 32 ounces for free compared to monster purple.4) the decision maker for me was the caffeine effect.  monster cans spread the energy rise/rush out over two hours.  solimno red hits you hard all at once and burns down quickly.  caffeine flush is guaranteed if you drink one fast.  for people who use a monster to manage shift work disorder, this is not for you. slow sipping a monster over an hour will be way more effective, leaving you less jittery.i will not be purchasing this again.  spend the extra $4 for a monster purple or orange.",Allergic

tear easily..... worst trash bags i've ever bought only giving 2 stars because the bottom is leak proof and i haven't had to clean the trashcan out. the reviews were good and there was a coupon to combine with subscribe & save so i decided to try them. i don't know know if i just got a bad box or what but i asked for a refund after trying them out for a while. the top doesn't stay up and the bag falls into the trash can. no matter how full the bag is when i pull the red strings to tie the bag it pretty much falls apart. the top completely comes off the bag or it tears some place else.,Quality/Contaminated

"wonderful product ! (not anymore!). after getting sick from a ruptured capsule of krill oil supplements that leaked all over my vitamins one day while on a trip, i decided to stop taking the krill oil and find a substitute. fish oil was even worse!  ugh!  the taste and smell of all of them was terrible; and i tried several from alaskan to salmon, etc, to no avail.  i decided to try this vegetarian supplement, flax seed, and it has been great!  no bad taste, shelf stability, and absolutely no after burps or upset stomach. i'm nearly through the first bottle and will order again. i don't know if it works as well as krill or fish, but i do believe it works good enough to be of benefit. after all, how good does it really have to be?update 4/22/19  ***  have to withdraw my previous praise for this product. toward the end of the bottle, maybe 20 pills remaining, i began suffering terrible intestinal and stomach upsets. after i eliminated a few other possible causes, it kept happening. finally, i read up on the side affects of flaxseed oil and saw that stomach and intestinal upsets were just about the number one side affect!  stopped taking it and, immediately, the upsets stopped and i get back to normal. this is not about nature made or ""x brand"" because both have excellent products and services. this is just about flaxseed oil in general. i won't touch the stuff again, that's for sure, in any form!",Bad Taste/Flavor

"basic multivitamin in a  very sugary chew form. as far as the vitamin content itself, this is a perfectly okay multivitamin, with a no-frills blend that seems on the cheap side. given the serving size of three gummies it's not particularly well priced for that; there is much cheaper competition in swallowable form available online and from stores like costco.the selling point (i guess) here is that, instead of a swallowable, it's an ""adult"" vitamin in a sweet chewy gummy form — perhaps for picky eaters? the flavor is synthetic and vaguely fruitlike, the texture is a bit mealy, and overall the taste is, first and foremost, extremely sugary: sugary enough to hurt your teeth a little if they're sensitive. and indeed each serving of the vitamins has a hefty 8g of carbs, and 6g of sugars, a pretty heavy dose for a non-food, non-meal supplement that presumably isn't going to substitute for any real food. apart from that, it's fine for what it is, i guess.",Bad Taste/Flavor

"generally good zinc/manganese supplement. very easy to swallow.. the nature's bounty clearcomplexion zinc plus manganese supplement seems like a good option for those looking for a zinc skin supplement. i got them for my wife hoping that it would help with her moderate rosacea, and while it hasn't made a hugely visible difference, she does say that it's helped with the intensity of it. the challenge with her is that she really hates having to swallow pills and capsules of any kind and these are small enough and easier to swallow than most supplements, so she takes it regularly.one thing to note here is that there is quite a bit of zinc here. at 30mg per serving (2 softgels), that's quite high (40mg is the tolerable upper intake level, but recommended dietary allowances are only 11mg for men and 8mg for women). depending on your diet and what other supplements you take (most multivitamins have 5mg or less), you could get to that level pretty quickly. with these, you can reduce it to one softgel and still get plenty of zinc (and while that might leave you lacking a big of manganese, that mineral is generally much easier to get from healthy dietary sources like grains than zinc is). that's what my wife has done, and she's still received benefit from it.",Too big to swallow

"disgusting fish smell and taste!. this brand of prenatal vitamin smells and taste like fish. i understand that it has dha in it, but i simply could not take it without gagging. do yourself a favor and have your ob write you a script for a prenatal.",Bad Taste/Flavor
"can taste the fish oil. these have a bad taste. they do have the strawberry to mask it, but it just goes down with a fishy taste. i prefer the honest co brand over these.",Bad Taste/Flavor
"taste nasty 🤢. please how can people say this amazing ,good .? hell noooooo this bars taste horrible i couldn’t eat them i was so excited because of all the good comments i saw about it next time i will definitely pay attention to the few bad comments 😢",Bad Taste/Flavor
don't waste your $. i took a chance on this brand and was sadly very disappointed. not impressed on how it was packaged. very disappointed when i poured it and tasted it. poured like water and tasted like pancake syrup. expensive pancake syrup. will not buy again. would not have given it one star but i couldn't submit otherwise.,Customer Service
the looks and taste is bad. the worst cookie i have ever seen or eaten.  the cookie looks and tastes like crap.  the quest brand is 100% better.,Quality/Contaminated
"sold out to nestle and refuses to correct the gross mold issue! our money is their chief concern!!!. ""is it really true that ""garden of life sold out to nestle""? i ask because i can't think of the last time that nestle had our best interest at heart when it comes to health. in fact, i find the exact opposite to be the case and now with this move, it just seems that they are more concerned with however they can make money/profits versus our overall health concerns. i mean, just look at their overall products if you beg to differ. i find it a bit ironic how some of the same companies that have been poisoning americans [and who knows how many others] for decades... only to turn around and buy out the companies that initially started out with the well-being of our health concerns first. for me, that is enough to make any health-conscious person suspicious: not to mention, that the bottles are now be manufactured in toxic-plastic now!""",Bad Taste/Flavor
