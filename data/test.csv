"good vegan choice, poor non vegan choice. i use the book 'fortify your life' by tieraona low dog, md to help me make more informed decisions regarding supplements.  i went over this supplement from ""x brand"" elements & found some negatives if you're not vegan:contains folate as folic acid.  folic acid is the synthetic form of folate.vitamin b12 as cyanocobalamin.  cyanocobalamin is the synthetic form.  this is a supplement that is targeted to vegans.  so this may not be an issue depending on what you are looking for.  however, the body is better able to absorb methylcobalamin, it is the form of b12 the body needs.vitamin c as ascorbic acid.  ascorbic acid is the synthetic form of vit.cvitamin d2 - this is a supplement that is targeted to vegans.  so this may not be an issue depending on what you are looking for.  however, the body is better able to absorb d3.  d3 is the optimal choice for good health.chromium as chromium chloride.  chromium chloride is the least absorbed form.contains iron.  this may not be an issue depending on what you are looking for.  teenage boys, adult men, women with very infrequent menstrual cycles, & postmenopausal women should not take multivitamins with iron.the probiotics are a joke.  there is no guarantee that you will get live beneficial bacteria at the time of consumption.  any good probiotic supplier will guarantee a particular amount of viable probiotic strain/s at the time of consumption (it will say it right on the label).personally, i feel that the pure synergy brand is the better choice for supplements.  i tend to use them most of the time.  there is another brand, mega food backed by dr. low dog that i haven't used, so i cannot speak on it's quality, but you may wish to check it out if you don't want/like the synergy brand.overall, this is a reasonable multivitamin for vegans due to ethical reasons for being vegan, not for actual good health.  but with that said, it's better than not taking a multivitamin at all."

"smell horrible!. i used to be loyal customer to this brand. i have been using these gloves for 5 years. however, i just opened a new box today, and the smell is really really really bad (smell looks like you burn a plastic bag). never paid attention before since the smell might not be so strong enough to notice. i am so disappointed and scared since i used it to cut fruits for my little one everyday. now use it to wash dishes."

"these suppliments don't work - no suppliment significantly changes neurochemistry. i bought these for my girlfriend, who i couldn't talk out of buying.  i have a ph.d. in neuropharmacology and know that taking high levels of the precursor chemicals the body uses to make neurotransmitters has no meaningful effect on the levels of those neurotransmitters in the brain.  it doesn't work that way.  i'm sorry, i wish it were that simple... don't believe the hype."
"heated damaged contents...not dusted almonds, but a glob.. the almonds were sealed, but not dusted separate almonds as they should be but were glued by chocolate in one glob. item not returnable.  thankfully, ""x brand"" gave me credit."
vitex. i really wanted to give these a try and noticed i was getting terrible headaches and narrowed it down to the vitamins. everyday i would wake up and take only one and then o would have a headache and stabbing head pain all day and also felt nauseous constantly. i thought i was just sick. then i read some of the reviews about vitex and how it’s not good. as soon as i stopped taking them i was back to normal no more pain or nausea. i really hope they just take that ingredient out.

"wrong description !!!  or wrong product?. i ordered cherry vanilla,  got blackberry. customer service said they would send cherry vanilla  guess what, got blackberry.  can you tell the difference?  picture, i ordered the left, got the right.  don't like the flavor of the blackberry!"

"these are not vegan, but ""x brand""'s customer service is great.. buyer beware: these vitamins are not technically vegan: there is an ingredient, vitamin d3; that comes from animal sources. i think these are designated as ""vegan"" because they claim that no animals were killed to make these (and that is likely true) but they do contain animal derived ingredients. that said, i think most vegans don't want to consume any animal derived ingredients. since i have allergies, i could not take these, and ended up giving them away. i will say that ""x brand""'s customer service is almost always great though; so i would not hesitate to order any of their house brand products, as they stand behind them and will remedy any issues if they don't work out."

"lack in flavor department. my children weren't a fan of the flavors. they only liked the orange which is 1:3. in their defense, i also tried these & wasn't a fan myself."
"disgusting. horrible, gritty, disgusting.  i have tried it a few times, i can't tolerate more than one sip."
"sticky, thick and a ugly taste. maybe good for you but i suggest they rework the solution."

this is not the organic all in one coconut almond that i thought i was ordering!. very disappointed!  i made a mistake and ordered the wrong vega product!  i don't like it at all.  the organic all in one coconut almond  is really tasty and for some reason the stores in my area stop selling the small packets that i can travel with. thought i was ordering the large container of the organic all in one coconut almond and instead got the vega protein powder that leaves a very bad after tastei am very disappointed!

"delivered broken. was broken upon delivery. the top broke off into the dropper hole.  so now i have to pour it, makes it really hard as most recipes call for “drops “ not pours.  wouldnt order from this seller againtaste is ok.. i’ll keep trying for other brands"
"cheap ineffective knock off. this product is essentially worthless. does not work at all. stick with claritin or zyrtec if you actually want something that works. cosco is usually comparable, but this isn’t even close. absolute garbage."

"organic, vegan, gluten-free, and good price. note that i currently take nature's way alive, which is a higher potency women's multivitamin that also contains enzymes, probiotics, and other goodies.these ""x brand"" elements vitamins contain the us rda or slightly above, with a cultured whole superfood addition. these are organic, vegan, gluten-free, and get 59% of their nutrients from whole foods.the tablets are actually not too big. my ester-c tablets are bigger! and they don't smell bad. at about $12/month, the pricing is good for this quality. just know that if you want more than the rda, you will need to add."

"some things i love, others i really don't. i love that these pack so much into a vitamin.  they are vegan, tons of vitamin's and mineral i need, a good number of herbs and other lesser known supplements to help round out in ways that traditional multi-vitamins ignore.  all that said they are huge.  i really would rather take two smaller pills than this one.  it also just tastes bad.  and it's not one of those that if you miss the first swallow you regret it, it's bad from the start.  then you burp that flavor for a while after...  i love the idea but i just can't get behind the actually doing it with this product."

broken. the top of the bottle was broken when i received it. even though it had a seal on the bottle it was open and leaking.
"not as fresh. this was my second time ordering these gummies and this time they were just not that fresh and a little hard. the seal was intact, the plastic was on and they were not expired so i dont know what went wrong."
horse pills!. whoever made these massive things has never been gaggy and pregnant let alone morning sick! 😂😂 they are massive and the taste is not unpleasant but very strong

"terrible shipping!!!. paid more to have shipped sooner and still don't have the product!!!! unacceptable! shipping has gone downhill with ""x brand"". :(  purchased on may 1st- don't have the product yet."
not so great for me. i wanted to like this product because it's got some good stuff in the ingredients and a good value at 50 cents a serving.  but it gave me mega diarrhea!!!!  like crappin my guts out every 40 to 60 min for the next 6 hrs.  so to avoid squats and deadlifts while taking this or you could have a blow out!  if your doing a low impact workout with quick access to a toilet and want to loose weight this might be good for that cause you'll be crappin out everything in your guts for the next 6 hrs.  flavor is good though but doesn't mix well.

didn’t receive. i didn’t receive coconut oil
"did not receive item. unfortunately, i can't rate this item because i never received the package.  it reads that it was delivered to the mailroom.  however the building closes at five.  they claimed they delivered at six."
glad it has helped others.. i bought this to see if it would aid with my prostatitis pain and discomfort.  i am glad it has helped other reviewers but it has not helped me at all and i have not noticed any other health benefit from taking it.
"do not buy this yucky stuff.. nasty. bought this mix as a less expensive alternative to shakeology. file under, ‘you get what you pay for’. this mix is watery, quickly separates and is ubersweet. there is essentially no flavor except sugar. it’s like drinking slightly grainy very watery syrup. you have to continuously stir it and drink fast with your nose pinched to get it down. i tried it twice just to give it a fair ‘shake’ as it were, and it is just undrinkable. now i’m stuck with a tub of crap. no money saved."

"gave it three attempts, each time felt horrible after using. i was hoping for the best with this supplement after reading some promising studies about the positive effects of quercetin on aging reversal and its apparent anti-inflammatory properties when dealing with ulcerative colitis.  unfortunately, this didn't work for me, and i would caution anyone in using it to proceed carefully.  i followed the directions, taking it 30 minutes prior to meals.  i started on the lowest possible dose, one per day (instead of the recommended two per day).  i took it for three days, and had to stop because it caused many side-effects including stomach pain, foggy brain, and anxiety (and i never ever get any anxiety).  i didn't notice anything positive or any other results from taking it other than the negative side effects.  i stopped after the first three days, gave it about a week off, and then tried again, and then the same thing happened on the second run and then again on a third run.  after the third run i have concluded this was causing me more pain and discomfort overall.  considering there are warnings about quercetin overuse and those with kidney issues should avoid, i would proceed carefully if i were you."

"works but bought in june 2019 and they expire in march 2020. we've bought these in the past and they work like the brand name version but at a fraction of the price. we've been very happy with them. just bought another package and they expire in 9 months (that's probably why they are so cheap). i was debating about returning them, but we'll probably go through most of them in that timeframe and besides, we're out in the midst of allergy season and so i would have ended buying expensive ones at the store."

"perfect for dairy intolerance. pretty chalky, even after shaking.  flavor is 4 stars. maybe if i put it in a blender it would be better. i use the powdered version for fruit smoothies, so i think i'll stick with the powder."

no noticeable positive effects. nature's bounty glowon beauty multivitaminsthese were easy enough to swallow for me.i did not notice anything different though with taking them even once they were completely gone.never noticed any negative reaction to taking them but in the end not something i would try again just because i did not seem to benefit from them in a way that would make it worth continuing with them.overall simply not the right formula for me personally.
taste is weird. not bad bad but definitely not good. weird taste. i had it with almond milk and it was a bit hard to mix even with a ninja.

"after intensive research.... i do not want to say the product may not work. but, if you are looking to lose weight quickly with regular exercise, and a clean diet this product can be used but it is for a long term results. however, i try to give honest and real reviews to help other buyers because sometimes the reviews seem to alter or completely not honest to me. (my opinion) i dislike to buy a product that does not live up to what is advertised which is inconvenient. for faster, weight loss result, i prefer daily high intense cardio, full body detox, cool sculpting, and use the sauna. no sugar, carbs, alcohol, or dairy products. eat fruits and vegetables with a lot of water.what i found online:research shows that (cla) conjugated linoleic acid (cla), which is a natural fatty acid found in meat and dairy products. has shown it is effective for fat loss in animals, but the evidence in humans is less promising. research in humans shows that cla has only a modest weight loss benefit which this translates to less than half a pound per month. please do not let these companies hustle you out of your money but use it at your own risk. i hope my review helps."

didn’t like the taste. this was ok just didn’t like the taste therefore didn’t use it that often. switched to just a regular capsule for my vit d and it’s much better
not good!. these regularly leaked around the sides and there evidently is no odor control. will not order again.

don't buy. taste nasty.
"birthday cake tastes terrible.. pros: this is a pretty good protein powder in terms of calorie/protein ratio. 130 calories for 24gms of protein.  blends well.cons: the only discernible flavor is stevia. it wasn't terrible drinking it for the first time, but i'm probably going to seriously regret this purchase in a week."
"doesn't work.. couldn't tell a difference.  overall i'd say do not buy supplements from ""x brand"", there are a lot of fakes.  spend a little more and buy them from a trusted retailer."

"bring back the old formula. totally gross. i used this product for many years and it was great!recently it was repackaged and reformulated. the new packaging is great... the taste is horrible.i used it once, could hardly drink it and threw the entire thing away. so sad. i used this as my morning coffee as i’m one of those rare peeps who is allergic to coffee."

"weird flavor. flavor was way too sweet and had a weird caramel flavor. it didn’t resemble coffee in anyway. i started to add collagen powder to it to help curb the sweetness. though i like most of the other flavors of on amino energy, this is not a flavor i will buy again."

"smells fishy. these are good for the price but it has a fishy smell. i’ve used magnesium for over a year now to help with my digestive system. with this bottle, this is the first time i’ve had magnesium that smells fishy and it doesn’t seem to work as well as others in the past."

get something else. way too strong even taking one tablet too strong made me feel weird and nasty after taste

not faint and definitely not strong. honestly sucked when i tried using for my body butters. i didn’t realize until after my purchase that it was diluted with jojoba oil (which is my fault for not seeing that). but even after realizing it was diluted the smell wasn’t even faint. i had to basically shove my nose down the bottle to even get a trace of any scent and it wasn’t even a nice vanilla smell but some weird burnt artificial vanilla smell. considering it’s $19 almost $20 at the time of this review i would say it’s not worth it for the amount you receive or the smell.
don’t purchase. bad stomach pain. do not take them. the heartburn ever!

"this is a fake product. do not buy.. let me start by saying i purchased this exact product from sprouts first, loved it, tasted fine( nothing great) but the energy was amazing. lasted and didn’t upset my stomach like coffee does.so i decided to see if ""x brand"" had it for cheaper as we all do with everything. well as soon as i mixed it in the water i thought this seems completely different than the last one i had bought from sprouts. tasted more sugary and just not the same. also upset my stomach and barely gave me any energy so i knew this wasn’t the real product. so i went to sprouts and bought the same exact one and compared (please look at my picture)  and it’s incredibly obvious that they are not the same product.  clearly there’s tons of sugar in this, or whatever those little crystals are. i’m just assuming all sugar.do not buy this it is not the same one, spend a few more dollars and get the real product in a store. i get mine from sprouts and i’ll never buy this brand from ""x brand""."

hard to rate when my two day delivery takes a week. seller did not deliver on time.
"chemical smell and taste!. i took the first bottle even tho it had a chemical smell and taste, but when the second bottle came, and i read other comments about this problem, i decided to return it. i think it is a good product, but worry about the chemicals!  if it’s the container causing this, they need to change the packaging!!  they are a very good company other than that!!"
broken lid. broken lid. frustrating.
it's a good price for isolate but the taste is pretty bad. i have not had unflavored whey in some time. when it's unflavored you really catch the taste of how it's processed. i have to say that the taste of this whey is pretty bad. it's not unusable but i would not get it again.

"i think 3 stars is what all protein powders are. this does not get a three star rating from me because i found it to be inferior in some way.  i suppose i didn't think the flavor was something i'm going to think to myself to sneak to the kitchen in the middle of the night to indulge in.  however, this is protein powder.  i don't drink it to indulge in extra sugar and carbs.  i drink the best protein powders i can find that seem to have the best ingredients available that meet my needs at that time.  this one does that for me, although i personally wish it did not have 3 grams of carbohydrates per serving. for me, as well as some others with chiari or seizure disorders, an extremely low carb diet will sometimes work and it has been for me.  lots of people will likely find this very useful."
wrong flavor. i ordered the chocolate one but they sent me the wrong flavor
did not work for me. did not do much for me. i found no difference in pain levels after consuming the entire bottle as directed.
"trash. i don't like this brand.  cayenne is weak.  their b vitamins do little.  i switched and found i felt great taking vita code.  i bought now for years and wondered why i felt like garbage.  their vitamin c is ascorbic acid, this is a man made chemical derived mostly from gmo corn and starch that has no vitamin c in it anyway, not only is it a gmo and bad for you but it has no vitamin c in it.  ""l""-asorbic acid is a whole food derived, true vitamin c.  i switched and did a flush with this and after a week i feel amazing.  if a company is misleading like this i don't trust them with anything.  and their b vitamins suck."

never got my order right. i never received my order. you kept sending me potassium instead.
"mixes well. but, the maple flavor was not for me.. i love this brand of protein. it is generally my favorite. it mixes well a ball is not even needed.but, this flavor taste like burnt maple . i tried it for two days, and came to the conclusion of life is short. i got rid of it quick. i will stick with the superfood berry."

"new wipes cause irritation. i have been happily using the unscented wipes for years, but this last order is different. the texture has changed and the chemicals in the wipes has caused me to feel burning and intense irritation. if your babies cry when you use these wipes please stop!"

"does not contain d3. as of this review this bottle of adult vitamins cost $22.39.  it's for a four month supply and only one pill per day is the dosage given, though the amount of a lot of the vitamins is only 1/2 the rda.  if two were taken then the full amount plus some extra would be taken.  they're basically o.k. except for the vitamin d2 content instead d3.  vitamin manufacturers often use d2 instead because it's cheaper to produce thus saving them money, but it's not really much good.  d2 mostly goes right through the digestive tract and into the toilet so very little get absorbed and it does practically nothing for bone health.  d3 on the other hand, costs a little more to manufacture, but is by far a superior form of vitamin d.  most of it gets absorbed and combined with a good k2 does a good job at maintaining good bone health.  i would be sure to take a good d3 supplement if taking these vitamins.the iron content might be too high for post menopausal women and i don't really know if men should be taking more iron or not.  but, it's a good amount for women who are menstruating.  18 mg is the rda and one of these pills gives 9 mg but that's not too bad.  overall, these are o.k. vitamins but not my first choice if i was buying them for myself."

"nothing. i had a very bad experience with this company. i have received my order when i opened the box one of the bottles was broken, i requested a return label from them to return the item but it has been 2 weeks since my order i haven’t received it. when i emailed them again they said it will be emailed to me shortly but i haven’t received it yet."

"soft & cute. so i've been using these diapers for about a month now. they are super cute and not a whole lot different from huggies. i should start out saying i'm using these with my 4th child. he is 1 and my oldest is 11. with my older kids i used luvs. when it came to my daughter i mainly used huggies. i did try pampers (to me it didn't hide the urine smell) and i tried luvs (who apparently changed their diaper design. they were noisy and smaller than they use to be). normally i subscribe to huggies but my shipment wasn't coming in time so i decided to try ""x brand""'s brand.pros:super cutesofturine indicator stripetrue to sizenot as expensive as huggiescons:doesn't hold as much.the diaper tears when you try to take the tabs off.i do like these diapers but i'm probably going to switch back to huggies. they come with more in a box and i don't have to go through as many. if i didn't have so many kids and have to watch my budget as much i'd stick with these."
"not working for me. it’s my 4th day taking these. so far i’m not seeing any positive effects. no changes in sleep or mood. as far as appetite suppression, they’ve had my stomach upset to the point where i don’t want to eat anything. earlier i was taking an exam in a quiet room and my stomach was constantly making noises (embarrassing)if something changes i’ll modify my review but so far these are a no from me."

"taste bad. this female nutrient sugar is not the same as the one i bought before, but they look very similar, i think it is misleading consumers.  another natural treasure of sugar is delicious, sour and sweet.  and this is very general, if i know it will definitely not buy.  absolutely bad reviews, children do not like to eat."

"wrong flavor over and over again!!!. my mom loves the chocolate shake, and it has actually helped her with some health issues she's been having.  however, she has been without this for over 2 months now because they can't seem to ship out the correct flavor!  i have only ordered chocolate.  i have triple checked the link to verify it's chocolate. i've exchanged the incorrect vanilla shipment and received vanilla again.  i called ""x brand"" customer service, who verified it was chocolate ordered, and told me they would correct it with the manufacturer, and to wait 24 hours to order again. i waited 48 hours... and mom received vanilla again.  i ordered through a different link (not the ""x brand""'s choice link), and, for the 9th time my mom received vanilla.  i have never left a bad review. i understand mistakes happen, but 9 straight times is simply incompetence. my mom has been without the nutrients she needs from this shake because they can't seem to get their items correct."

"item did not arrive cold. i was excited to get this product for my daughter but when i received it in the mail the cold packs were not cold. they were actually warm. i was home when it was delivered so it didn't sit outside in the heat or anything. i became worried that the organisms would not have survived since the product was not kept cold like it is supposed to be, and like how they advertise it to be. i decided that i was going to return the product but when i logged on to ""x brand"" to return it it said that returns were not allowed on this item. i believe this to be a good product but if i were you i would try to buy it in a store, not on ""x brand"". shipping is to risky. there is no guarantee that it will be cold when it gets to you, and if it is not you are stuck with the item."
bad. taste not good
did not receive. i did not receive this item.
poor sleep. did not work.
hard to dissolve and flavor is bad. does not dissolve at all. even in a nutribullet! flavor is too artificial for my palate.

this is bs. i haven't even received my product and i ordered at the beginning of may. the tracking number that they gave me does not work and nobody has responded to any of my emails.
so artificial fruit flavor. this is the weirdest taste gummy i have ever  tried. it is not bad flavor or harsh flavor. it is so artificial taste. every time it reminds me the old time candy with that low quality industrial artificial fruit flavor. every time i have to take a piece of chocolate right after this to flush away that taste. so....buy something else.

it’s too big to swallow. wanted to take the fish oil for plantar facilities problem and tried this.pros: it’s cheapcons: it’s really big soft-gels to swallow and sometimes it’s sticky inside the box with others.

"harsh on my digestive system. i haven't noticed anything different in a positive way for me (better sleep or any weight loss) in the 10 days that i've been taking this product.  i have noticed it is harsher on my stomach and intestines for sure in the morning when i wake up.  my boyfriend, however, has been taking them too and he has lost 11 lbs.  we both have changed our eating patterns for the better and exercise.  i haven't noticed anything on the positive side but he has.  i'm willing to stick with it a few more days.  he'll probably stick with it much longer."

"seal broken. i just got these in today and was very excited to try them but they arrived with the seal broken. not a happy customercalled ""x brand"" and they are shipping a replacement, i will update once replacement received."
ended up in the er after one pill!. 500 mg is 142 times the amount an adult female should take. i took one pill and had an instant burning red-rash from my scalp to my toes that lasted for hours. i ended up in the er and had to take a prescription there to bring down my intense reaction. i realize not everyone will have this reaction but please be careful!!!
does nothing. i noticed no change or improvement or reason to keep taking this.
horrible taste. i bought this product back in december and i have not been able to finish it because of its horrible taste.  once you take it you keep tasting the flavor for hours.  i love garden of life products but this is the worst product i come across in the natural world.
"good vitamin, bad pill.... i'm sure it does what it's supposed to... but very hard to swallow these... they stick to your tongue and throat... extra extra water"

does not dissolve. this stuff is so clumpy and it gets gross really quickly. i know it doesn't magically dissipate into a solution because of what it is but i would expect it to be at least drinkable.
my kids don't like the taste. the bear design is cute. and i like that it's chewable rather than a gummy since our dentist said to avoid gummy vitamins. but my 8 and 5 year old don't care for the taste. the box said it's cherry berry but my kids said it tasted like bananas and they don't care for the taste of them at all unfortunately.
"didn't receive. ordered two, package arrived not sealed/taped with only one inside. otherwise these are always my go to prenatals."
"one of the jars is unusable. one of the two jars had a broken seal and there was oil and butter everywhere. needed the other jar for a recipe that day so i can't return, but i'm afraid to use the jar with the broken seal. good product, but problem with shipping and he only option i'm given is to return it, which. can't do."
"don’t buy!!!. this stuff is gross!! open the bottle and it smells like rotten fish guts, horrible!!"
"don’t buy!!!. this stuff is gross!! open the bottle and it smells like rotten fish guts, horrible!!"
"moisturizing but greasy, greasy, greasy  & takes about 30 minutes to absorb. this gets 2.4 stars from me.  this is very moisturizing but it is super greasy and takes about 30 minutes to absorb into my skin. i wish it had a fragrance because fragrance free does not mean it does not smell. it smells like vaseline to me and i do not like that smell which is why i wish there was a nice perfume to this.my hands felt very soft after using this cream, so i loved the results. i just hate that greasy feeling that takes a long time to dissipate. note that it is a very thick cream perfect for use in the winter months."
it is ok. not competitively priced. has no discernable difference from lower priced products
hate the taste. i do not like the taste of this powder at all....although it does provide a creamy texture

caused constipation despite clear promise otherwise. gave my wife constipation after taking.  this then resulted in hemorrhoids which made her life exceptionally difficult with new baby.  had neither of these problems for two weeks following delivery until taking this.
"missing product. i ordered 4 bottles, but only received 3bottles."
caused delayed aggressive flush. took it at 7 am now at 1130 am i am so flushed and uncomfortable unfortunately i cannot leave work i’m stuck here itching and burning until it subsides

quality. this does not help me at all as far as energy before work out it i don't feel any kind of energy or even strength to work out.
"they changed the formula!!!. for more than 15 years i've been buying this flavor, due to it's excellent quality, natural taste and noticeable performance. the manufacturer decided to revamp the flavor by adding sucralose and changing the mint flavor, and now it tastes so aweful. like another reviewer states.  ""it is the perfect example of how to convert a great product into a complete disaster. the new version is naturally and artificially flavored, tasting horribly.  i am returning it!""  optimum nutrition why????!!"
gross plastic taste. i read some of the reviews about it having a funky taste possibly due to the packaging and i have to agree. overall i think the probiotic itself works. i noticed less bloating and it wasn’t too big to swallow but i couldn’t get past the gross taste. it’s like a weird plastic taste. the taste alone makes me not recommend it. you don’t have to refrigerate it but i tried it that way too to see if the taste would go away and it did not.

"will spend more next time to just pick up at pharmacy, took too long to get here.. guaranteed on the 7th, then showed delivery by the 10th, were order on the 4th. did not arrive until the 13th. the new deliver service of ""x brand"" apparently lost the order then reshipped it.  bring back ups and fed ex delivery."
yucko. i don't care what the package says there has got to be another ingredient in there besides just so called organic cashews because they taste like an after taste like a chemical thing going on i'm going to try to salvage them and slim shady them over with a trail mix of sorts like you know pineapple raisins coconut something cuz they're they're nasty actually they're actually kind of nasty gross thank you
"gave me terrible anxiety. i’ve loved new chapter vitamins for years. i took the prenatals throughout all of my pregnancy, and the postnatals while breastfeeding. i decided to try these for the hormone support. but i had an awful reaction. i believe that it is the maca in these that gave me terrible anxiety. i was panicked all day long and constantly on the verge of an anxiety attack. once i realized that the symptoms started when i started taking this multivitamin, i immediately stopped taking them and started to feel better again. after the fact, my doctor told me that she was very worried for me when i went in to her while on these. she said she thought i might end up in the hospital with a nervous breakdown! it was so scary. but luckily, i’ve been feeling fine since stopping them. i knew that maca made me feel anxious, and i should have read the ingredients more clearly. if you know that you are sensitive to maca, do not take."
"flavors mix with each other. the jar has a good mix of flavors, however the buttery popcorn and black jelly beans over power the others so that when you eat a cherry or fruit it carries the tastes of buttered popcorn with it."
satisfactory price. delivered w/ some leakage.  must have received a bad batch.  will continue to look elsewhere
"does not work. i don't know if more than half of the reviews on ""x brand"" are fake but this supplement did not work at all. i want my money back. i will not buy again."

not the best. this was my 3rd vegan protein powder that i’ve tried and it was by far the worst. too gritty and the flavor just wasn’t good at all in my opinion. i would shake it up in a bottle after the gym and it would be so foamy that i could barely enjoy it. couldn’t wait to finish the container so i could stop using it.
"owned by nestle' now, so goodbye gol. the flavor of these bars is actually very good. i do like them, but will no longer be buying them due to the purchase of the company by nestle'.i had no idea nestle' had bought garden of life until today. they bought gol back around the end of 2017 or beginning of 2018. i had five gol items on my subscribe & save list but will now be cancelling all of them and finding other options. boycott nestle'! vote with your wallet"
misleading listing!. the listing for this item makes you believe it is for two boxes. the cost is definitely what others sell two for . the listing is for 30 + 30 but only one box of 30 is sent. what a horrible misleading description .  will never purchase anything from this seller again
it's ok. these are just as good as other gummy brands and don't stick to teeth like their multivitamin gummies which i won't ever buy again...these melatonin's i will.
"good choice. c4 is great. i ordered protein  powder  also but apparently it won't be  here for a few more days. not good. i guess  2 day shipping is a thing of the past. i think i will only order hard to find items from  ""x brand""."
"be wary of expiration date when you shop online. we received the product at the end of apr 2019. however the expiration data is aug 2019. this is a large bottle with 170 pills, close to 3 months worth of supply. if a consumer wants to finish it before the expiration date, he/she will have to start taking it right away from the date it is received, and not miss a date. this is intended to be a gift for a family member whom we won't see until a month later. such a short time window makes it nearly unusable as a gift. we are not very happy with the purchase. with that said, the item is well packaged and arrived promptly as scheduled."

useless. it was melted
did not work. ineffective
didn't work. didnt work
"not a quaker chewy. tend to come apart easily; stick to wrapper; chocolate chips fall off easily; off taste compared to quakergreat price!  if you’ve never had the equivalent quaker chewy, it is an adequate granola/chocolate bar"
very neutral. it takes like a standard protein powder. kind of good kind of gross.
not for me. this product didn’t work for me. it just caused me to become bloated.
this is a waste of money—results worse. product is garbage.  i ordered right after receiving test results showing low vitamin d.  at the urging of my endocrinologist i ordered this vitamin d once a day supplement and took for 6 months.  new recent 6 month results show my vitamin d lower than my results 6 months ago.  i’ve taken this every day for 6 months. what a placebo waste that didn’t work.  probably a sugar pill. disposing immediately.
made hubby very sick. made my husband very sick
too expensive for the strength.. *i bought this when i thought i ran out.  i recently looked at the composition.  for the money this is wayyyyy too expensive.  pass on this and go to piping rock.  way cheaper and better strength

"misleading description. only 500 mg.. the seller keeps asking for a review which i have ignored till now. these are not 1,000 mg. they are 500mg. so you are paying twice the price and getting half the product. good product, bad price."

bugs crawling all over! opened box!. bugs!
"check the safety seal!. this product arrived with the box open but i figured it may have popped open during shipping. upon opening the bottle, the safety seal was already half opened"
sucks at dissolving. now i'll start this review by stating i have a decent tolerance level when it comes to preworkouts.  i decided to try this one month ago and just finished it. i am pretty disappointed with the results.i did as the bottle suggested and started with one scoop and escalated from there. turns out i needed 3 1/2 scoops to feel the pump and it really only lasted for about half my workout. workout was only between 30-45 minutes.the biggest annoying factor was that the powder is terrible at dissolving. the flavor was strong and good. once you reach the bottom its like swallowing a pixie stick. by far the worst thing about it. not happy qith it but will work for beginners or those who are not tolerant to it

"aftertaste is too much.... not sure if it’s because they are drops instead of a powder/granulated product, but the after taste with these was too much for me to handle. i started with their recommended drop amount and then ended up decreasing each day trying to find the right ratio for my coffee. on the plus side i feel like i weaned myself into drinking black coffee because the bitterness of just the plain black coffee was better than the aftertaste of the drops."
"why can't ""x brand"" send me what i ordered?. the product illustrated here is a good product and i have ordered it repeatedly.if you look at the first illustration, you will see that it is vitafusion beauty sleep melatonin cherry-vanilla flavored gummies. this is what i ordered.when i ordered these again this week, ""x brand"" sent me the natural berry flavored ones.  my wife hates natural berry flavored gummies. i attempted to return them using the return item function.  i clicked on the ""wrong item sent"" button. the system informed me that i need not return the incorrect item and asked how i wanted them to proceed. since i still needed the originally ordered product i foolishly checked ""send same item"" button thinking that they would send me what the order showed that i had ordered.wrong. in their infinite wisdom, ""x brand"" sent me the exact same wrong item. i tried to return this second incorrect shipment only to be told that it can't be returned. it's now to late to order the correct item using a different displayed item and have it arrive in time for a trip.there appears to be no way to contact ""x brand"" to straighten this fiasco out, so i am submitting this review hoping it may catch someone's eye.  if nothing else, i may succeed in warning another customer of their sometimes slipshod service."

"jipped. i received this package in march, but i just opened it today. this was supposed to be a two-pack. normally it comes shrink-wrapped with two bottles. i only received one bottle. i will not order from this company again! i only gave it one star because i had to."
"feels like i've been poisoned by vitamins. i expected this product to be excellent because of the price & ingredients listed. however, after taking for about a week, i felt like going to the er to check my vitals. i had a pulsing headache & palpitations that terrified me. i wondered about toxicity, if i was getting too many vitamins, & stopped taking for about a month. i felt back to normal, then tried again to see if it was any different. same thing; i have a raging headache that feels like my brain is being squeezed, and my heart has been racing & skipping beats all day. it's a scary feeling, like the vitamins are poisonous. i will never take these again."

check the size on these before you buy.. i feld to notice the actual size on these pills.  huge!!!! i will find another nature’s bounty or another brand that isn’t this large and difficult to swallow.
did nothing for me.. did not see the benefits it is marketed to provide.  noticed no change.  for me it's not worth taking even if it was free.
"smells terrible. these smell so bad, when i bought them there wasn’t a mention of a smell. it is a weird “linen” smell, but i would not recommend."

"packaging. i ordered this product twice. the first time it came the box was damaged and the liquid was leaking. poor packaging. ""x brand"" was gracious enough to send me a 2nd bottle. the 2nd bottle came in the very same shape. it wasn't ""x brand""'s fault as this came from a 3rd party seller. i will not re-order this particular brand in a liquid again. their vitamins/herbs in a pill form, no problem, but liquids are not packaged securely enough to prevent breakage/leakage."
"vanilla is really cinnamon flavor. i use vegan protein powders for breakfast smoothies.  i was using san nutrition rawfusion plant protein powder vanilla for years and i thought i would try this. this powder blends well and doesn't have the chalky taste i've grown used to with the san powder. my first sip of my smoothie and all i could taste was cinnamon. at first i thought my mind was playing a trick on me because this very much says vanilla on the container. continuing drinking my smoothie i started looking at the ingredients and lo and behold cinnamon is on the list. i wont be buying this again, when i buy something labeled vanilla, it should taste like vanilla. at least the san powder has vanilla taste despite its chalkiness."
mold!!!. once i opened the container i noticed the mold. very disgusted. i'm returning them asap.
"bad batch(es), good customer service.. the expiration date was 2 weeks away from when i received, which is totally fine, however these must be stored pretty poorly in the warehouse as they are hard, bad tasting and near impossible to eat. i had to reorder and a second box was sent with the same expiry and had the same issue. we tried one more time and i was told they would check the dates in the warehouse before sending out and the replacement for my replacement arrived again with the same expiry and the exact same issue. i was stuck with 3 boxes of inedible protein bites and very disappointed.""x brand""’s customer service was great, as always. aside from not checking the dates and being sure to not send me the same expiry as i was told, they worked to try and fix the problem and in the end just had to refund me."

not worth the money. it wears off in two or three hours.  other brands work much better.
very large pill. i just got this multivitamins for my son but the pill is to large and very hard to swallow. i will need to find multivitamin.

"sent the wrong product. be careful.  you will not receive the same product that is pictured. i ordered the double pack of d3 2000iu vitamins however i received d3 50mcg(2000iu) bottles. this means that in order to get the same dose of vitamin d 2 pills will need to be taken instead of the usual 1. its a scam and a shame considering its from the company that makes the pills not a third party seller on ""x brand""."

strong chemical odor. i had high hopes for this product as i have been happy with other garden of life products.  the pills (or maybe it was the plastic container) had a strong chemical smell.  gave me a headache.  i returned the product.

deceiving labeling not as advertised does not have that many probiotics. labeling is deceiving falsely advertised it definitely does not have that many live probiotics at all way way less

received an opened item. the bags are great but i was really disappointed when the box was clearly opened and damaged before it was shipped. i do not know why it was still sent that was.
bad quality. falls apart too easily
shipping. shop easy seller does not give me tracking number. and don't answer. what the hell...
i want to love this product.. the bottle smells awful making the capsules smell awful. i’m reluctant to take them.
"unfortunately ineffective. i can really only review this for me but after a week, my energy levels dropped dramatically.  i would wake up after 8-9 hours of sleep exhausted and nearly fall asleep by mid-day.  maybe it clashed with another supplement or medication but i couldn't finish my second bottle and only made it that far because i stopped taking several other things to figure out what was the issue.  a few days after stopping test hd, my energy levels returned to normal."

"revised review after longer usage. below is my original review. after using it for another few weeks i started feeling it work a bit more. it is still not as efficient as their drowsy version, but it gets me through the regular days. on the strong allergy days it is not enough though. i revised my review from 2 to 3 stars. for the price, i can recommend it to people who do not have severe allergies. it got great reviews by many others, so it could also just be that it doesn't work on me but is a great product for most people.original review:i use the drowsy version from the same brand for a few years now, but it does make me sleepy, so i wanted to try this one. it didn't work at all. so many people gave it great reviews, so i am not sure why. i give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the brand does make other products that worked for me. i will keep looking for a non-drowsy that works for me."

very bad. i have received this item. but it's not brand new and the inside package has been opened. i dare not give it to the children. i'm worried if there's anything wrong with the gummy
not for us. this daily vitamin wasn't liked by the men in my household. they complained about the large size of the vitamins. they also said that they seemed to cause stomach issues (excessive gas and more frequent #2 trips)  it was also reported to me that the vitamins do not contribute to any an increase in energy level. i wouldn't choose these for my family again.
daughter loves them.. my daughter can not tolerate dairy so these are what we use to substitute so she able to get the recommended calcium and she loves the taste of them.
very disappointed. product arrived warm. ice pack had thawed and condensation got through the plastic wrap and warped the cardboard box. likely killed the probiotics. very disappointed. will not order again.

smell like rotten fish. these prenatal vitamins were a waste of my money. i used to get rainbow light and switched to these because they were more affordable. they smell like rotten fish! i don’t recommend these to anyone!
arrived damaged. decided to keep the product instead of going through the hassle to return since the inside protection was still intact but overall it arrived damaged the cap was broken so i will have to find something else to put it in

doesn’t work for me.. i’ve  used the product for two weeks without any results. i even started taking two at night thinking maybe that would help. i still wake up in the middle of the night and can’t fall back to sleep. additionally the pills are huge. i usually have no issues swallowing pills but these are difficult for me. they are the biggest pills i’ve ever seen.

great deal for simple items. get what you pay for with these. they're very thin and the zipper breaks easily. i bought them for the purpose of helping organize my breast milk freezer storage and they are not good for that. would probably be good for other things.
"not for me.... i've read lots of both good and bad reviews and decided to give a try... from the 1st one, i got stomach pain and nausea.  i was wondering if i keep taking it with smaller dosage, my body might get used to it and start working... but no.  it was bad enough that i couldn't keep taking it more than a week.  so, it wasn't for me.  i didn't lose weight at all and instead became sick for a while... unfortunately, it was a total waste..."

arrived shattered with glass pieces everywhere. so bummed. i really needed these. they weren’t going to arrive in 2 day prime but i was willing to wait. they arrived in an envelope. the jar is glass so it needed more protection that just a thin envelope. i opened it only to have pieces of glass fall out and all over my kitchen floor. it was broken in two places and small glass all mixed in with the tablets. no way i’m giving that to my kids now. please do not ship glass items in envelopes. 😕i hope i can get a replacement shipped in a secure box.
"falsified labeling thanks to the fda. these do not contain real folate, which is extremely important during pregnancy. there are better options out there, stay away from these and other gol products they are a deceitful company."
"no noticeable difference. unfortunately, i did not notice any calming/ relaxing effect from these.  they are a chewable gummy & the serving suggestion is 2 gummies per day.  the flavor was ok, but not something i’d reach for or even want to eat daily.  they are easy to chew and i did not have any stomach upset, so that’s good. it’s good that they come in 2 different sized bags so you can purchase the smaller, less expensive one to try them to see if they work for you."

wrong flavor. this was re order i always order vanilla and it came chocolate .. been ordering this product for almost a year always get vanilla and it came chocolate
not a good product for certain recipes. bad after taste stays gritty in some recipes

one star. extremely sweet
"powder taste artificial. same package as the other ones i bought from  local store; but not sure why, powder taste artificial and a hint of plastic smell. maybe not proper stored/sun exposure?"
"doesn't taste good. i like the sugarfree yummi bears better. these have no gelatin in it so that is why i bought them. i will not buy them again. they taste liek you're actually eating a vitamin, yeck!"
note it is 3 not 1 a day. you need to take 3 a day so this ended up being much more expensive than i’d thought in buying it. unfortunately i never notice a difference in taking vitamins but this one seems high quality.
"may contain gluten. i’m not sure how i feel about the product. i read, “processed in a facility with products that msg contain soy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, milk, fish, selfish and wheat. i have a gluten sensitivity. i’m hoping to find a more vegan friendly vitamin. i will give them to my sister, instead of sending them back. the package was great. my item arrived secure with an ice pack inside."

"just ew..... it was just gross, used for a meal replacement but the moment i took a bite out of it, i started to gag. and no, i'm not new to protein bars and this was the nastiest one i have tasted. maybe it was the flavor but it just tasted like dirt. power crunch bars are so much better."
yeck. could not get past the iron taste also upset the stomach not for me. i had my friend who is pregnant try them too same for her she threw them up they are very harsh on the stomach
package sent to wrong address. never received
"gives me a nasty headache!. from the first day i took this supplement it gives me a nasty headache.  i stopped taking it for a week to make sure that the headache was not being caused by something else.  it took about four days for the headache to go away.  i normally do not get headaches, so it was really scary.  the worst headache i ever had.  i started taking it again and the first day that i started taking it again, the nasty headache returned.  it's like all the nerve endings inside my head shoots pain.  i am disappointed, because i was looking forward to the antioxidant health benefits i read about.  not for me."
"wrong item. this is not what i ordered , can it be replaced with what i did order"
"cayenne after math.... arrived in a good time.  started taking the next morning. took daily for two weeks; tolerating the taste and smell and heartburn the entire time.  finally, decided to stop.  may be good for your health, but my stomach could not take it another day.  i suffered terribly with heartburn.  the taste left in my mouth was horrific as well. not worth it for me.  the bottle sits in my closet."
"meh.. leaves lint when used, scent has some sort of weird after-smell. very difficult to open the plastic opening. it’s just wipes but i am better to just buy some at walmart. ugh."
"gross flavor. apparently, i missed the part of the description that said this vitamin was strawberry flavored. these pills may do what they are supposed to, but they are disgusting. i don’t need flavored, non chewable tablets. it’s just gross. i won’t be buying it again.while i hate strawberry flavor as a general rule, they could be chocolate flavored, and i would be just as unhappy."

"awful tasting....no flavor. i read many reviews that this product was the perfect basic whey protein powder.......it may be a solid product in that it does what it is designed to do; provide optimum protein at a reasonable price. but, it has no flavor at all. overall, very disappointing if it's hard to drink."
no good if you're wanting help not cramping. i bought these because they were supposed to help with cramping. i'm not noticed any difference
bad taste. i just don’t like the taste it’s gross

"did not work for us. only tried these one time. both my teen daughter and i tried them one night. both of us, in separate rooms, were awake almost all night. not sure why, as different melatonin tablets have worked well for each of us. wish they had worked, and maybe they would have if we tried again, but neither of us wanted to risk losing more sleep. oh well."
"old, stale cookies were sent. not edible!. i purchased this for my father. i have sent him these cookies before and he loved them. this time he said they were not edible.  the chocolate had melted the cookies together and they appeared to be 10 years old."
"they are like the small always. these are okay for your light days, but the first couple days, no way. some of these have had issue with sticking and i think the wings are way too long. they do absorbe fine and they are comparable to always."
did nothing. did nothing.
"decent soap except for the scent.. i wanted to love this because of the affordable price point, but it smells like cheap hotel soap. i can say that i like the thick consistency of it, it reminds me of dove sensitive- it lathers and cleans just fine and doesn't irritate my skin, but i just can't get past the awful smell. i thought it was too good to be true, $15 for four 22-oz bottles. well, the old adage is true in this case that you get what you pay for. it's like they went with the cheapest generic soap scent they could find. will probably be asking for a refund on these and switching back to dove. three stars because you can't beat the price, but i knocked off two for making me smell like a motel 6."

"will sitck to your teeth. can't really chew these gummies because they will get stuck to your teeth. you are better off just sucking on it until it dissolves, but then again why get the gummies to begin with? i'd recommend the vitafusion multivitamin even if you're saving a couple of $$"
horrible taste. taste is so bad. i tried mixing with other stuff can’t get past taste.

"horrid taste but seems good for energy. i'm a relatively healthy 40 year old female. i experienced extreme life losses over the last month & have not been able to eat or keep food in, due to stress. i figured i'd try this based on the positive reviews. i had a great figure and i don't want to lose anymore weight. i followed the instructions and mixed it with water. i purchased the vanilla. my god is it sweet and thick. i can't even get in two sips i mean it's really, really disgusting. i'm going to try to just shut off my taste buds and get it down, but if you don't like sweet things, this is not recommended based on taste alone. update: like an hour later. i literally power slammedit. it took everything i had not to puke it up, but about 40 mins after drinking it, i noticed a big increase in energy. more energy from even coffee. especially being so sapped from stress, grief & poor diet, i'm really lacking in any energy at all. i was not expecting this stuff to give you energy. it was a great surprise! i'm going to try to stick with it."

"be aware of the size of this purchase. the product itself is amazing. but these sellers dont show you the actual size, they list grams which is misleading. lok for sellers that give the options for serving size so your well informed on how much you are buying......"
"lime and lemon flavor is terrible. the product might give some results, but the flavor is super bitter. it does not taste lime and lemon. i will not buy it again"

"shipping is super slow!. went on vacation and had it sent to the address i am staying at.  it says it was delivered, however it was turned over to the post office and they put it on a barge to alaska (where i am vacationing) and is not estimated to arrive for 2 more weeks!! i will definitely be contacting ""x brand"" over this shipping delay!!! the only reason i put a 1 star is because the review forces you to put something!"
tastes like fake sugar like a whole mouth full. okay why did they change it? it was so good before now it taste like i'm drinking fake sugar. in the trash it goes. it use to be so amazing with a real taste and now it's like drinking diet soda. it's way too sweet. they should come out with the old version because this version is going to ruin them. i'm seriously trying not to get sick right now.

didn’t work for me. didn’t like them
"on the dry side, but not bad overall. i find them to be on the dry side. i like costco brand much more but thought i would try these because of the subscribe and save discounts. i find i use 2-3 wipes when i only needed one from the costco wipes. they get the job done but i wont buy again."
"odd taste. they tasted like they were boiled in hotdog water. i love cashews, and got these after reading the positive reviews, but these just tasted completely off."
open container. the lid on this item was not on correctly and the seal was broken so we did not use them. i received a refund but probably won't order again.
expiration date too soon. bought 6 bottles on may 2019 and they expire on august 2019.
"i am an extremely frustrated customer after two bad bottles!. what happened to these pills?? i have taken these for a long time and the last two bottles have been so extremely fishy and foul that i could not consume them.  opening the bottles was such a disappointing experience because i love nn and now i do not know whether to switch or give them one more try.  i understand that bad batches may happen but this was 2 bottles and they have different numbers on them.  i don’t know if the supplier is storing them incorrectly or the shipper is to blame or it’s just no longer the quality i was used to.  either way, i’m not getting my daily supplement in for the first time in 7 years.  extremely frustrated as a loyal customer to nordic naturals.  :("

"no strong opinion here. don't dislike it, simply prefer another brand."
"about to expire. expire data is 10/2019, i just brought it on 5/2019, how can i finish it whin five months?"
"not for me. i'd read a lot of positive reviews about this product, so i had high hopes. unfortunately, it rubbed my throat raw when i drank it...even using half of the recommended amount in the water. the taste was not pleasant, either, although i could have dealt with it had it not given me a throat ache. i didn't notice a difference in my...er...bowel movements, either. however, that may be in part because i couldn't take in much of it."
"yuck. i’m sure it would be fine for others, but i just can’t stand the taste of these. i’ll probably end up throwing them away. which is disappointing, i keep trying to deal, i just can’t"
not delivered product. product not arrived
"just doesn't work well for me. i have a hard time falling asleep some nights.  mostly it's because i have a lot on my mind and i can't shut it off until i'm so dead tired i finally fall asleep after nearly 2 hours of just lying there.  luckily this is not the norm, but can happen about once or twice a week, especially after a stressful day at work.  i've been using diphenhydramine for my sleep aid and it works very well.  it can usually send me to sleep about 30 minutes after taking it, and i wake up rested and ready to go.i thought i would give a natural sleep aid a shot, because i would rather use a natural sleep aid than a chemical one.  i've tried using this melatonin product 3 different times under the same circumstances that i would have used diphenhydramine, but this did not send me to sleep like diphenhydramine does.  sure i eventually fall asleep, but after over an hour and that's not what i'm looking for.  for all i know that was just normal fatigue causing me to sleep.  i can't say this product does anything for me.  oh well, back to the old stuff."
made me sick. made me very sick; i want a refund.
tastes very fake. tastes so sweet but its like fake sugar.... i would rather them just put real sugar in or make it less sweet.
no dha in this vitamin!. everything about these prenatal vitamins are good except...... there is no dha! health care providers recommend taking a prenatal vitamin that has folic acid and dha. this lacks dha.
the taste is a no for me. this tastes so awful and strong. there's always chalky clumps no matter how hard i've tried to blend it. even the smell of it now makes me want to vomit. it just tastes so artificial.
"flavored energy seltzer. taste is definitely lacking. doesn't go down easy, but it'll get the job done."
"cannot swallow. too large to swallow, and even hard to get down when cut into thirds. disappointed, as i was looking forward to adding this to my regimen."
don’t buy lol. tastes horrible!!! never buy again and it doesn’t mix well.
where’s my package?. i haven’t received this package
"great feel and fit, just not absorbent at all. i have a 15 month old. we currently use seventh generation diapers. decided to try these because they’re much cheaper. they’re good diapers. they fit nice, they’re really soft like honest diapers, my only complaint them (which is a total deal breaker) is theyre not absorbent. my son peed through three of them in two hours and he’s never done that with any other diaper. also my son had some of the gel particles on him. i know it says on the package it can happen but i’ve never had it happen with another diaper. super disappointed they didn’t work for us, we won’t be buying more 😔"
"broken cap/ not sure about the quality yet. i just got them today and the cap is broken, for 30 dollars i feel like it should be perfect packaging haha"
no difference i can see!. i have been taking these for about a month a this point and while i have not specifically seen any change or difference in my skin texture/elasticity or aging. my skin is just like it was prior to taking these....the softgel's are a small size and have no taste. they are easy enough to swallow and the color is quiet nice. at the current price of $17.99 for a 45 day supply i would not purchase this once i am finished with this set.

pills flake after opening bottle. would not buy from this seller again. pills would flake out even tho the bottle says it expires at a later time. purchased again from a reliable source and didn’t have that flaking pill issue.

"these have the worst smell and vitamin-y taste. not like their other products i tried.. i purchased another variety of vitamin (undeniable beauty, with c, e, biotin and keratin) and loved them and had great results. before i even opened the bottle of these i could smell a very strong smell of vitamins. which is totally different than the experience i had with their other product. it was worse than the smell from the tablets i usually taste. i almost didn't eat one but i took a chance and regretted from the moment i put it in my mouth. the gummy tasted like pure vitamins, and not in a good way. i'd much rather take my regular multi-vitamin. i tasted vitamins in my mouth and burped it up for hours. i tried to give them to my mom and she couldn't take it either. i don't know how the two products from the same company can vary so much. the other product had zero vitamin taste, i left that other product i mentioned a 5-star review. i had to throw the bottle away because i couldn't take the smell, never had an experience like that with vitamins, where you could smell them with the jar closed. maybe i got a bad jar? i don't know, but i will stick with my regular multi-vitamin. i do however highly recommend their undeniable beauty, they have a great fruity taste."

this product has kratom in it.. i was taking this supplement and no other supplements or drugs.  i took a urine drug test and tested positive for kratom.  kratom is a controlled substance in some states and i got interrogated by my doctor. he said that kratom can cause liver damage and has killed over 100 people in the us since 2018.
waste of money. really bad & waste of money
"stuck together. i received 3 bottles and the garlic tabs are stuck together in all 3 bottles. i can try and separate, but make a huge mess in the process."

good vitamins .. but taste isn’t so good. i ordered these to try the orange flavor! they definitely do not taste as good as the pink bottle.
rotten!. more than half the bag was rotten!  i had to pick out the bad nuts before i could eat them.

"very hard on stomach. while i know this vitamin is to be taken with food, i would think that a bowl of cereal would suffice.  it did not.  my son ate a bowl of cereal and had yogurt before taking this vitamin.  he ended up vomiting it up when he got to school.  no matter what he ate for breakfast, his stomach was upset.  unable to tolerate them at all.  had very high hopes for this reasonably priced product.  now i am stuck with an almost full bottle..."

could be better. these are just”ok” tasting and do stick to your teeth. could definitely be better. cant tell if the vitamins are doing anything...
received the wrong wipes.. i always order this brand of wipes for my baby. this time i was sent the wrong item. i ordered the fresh scent wipes and received the un-scented ones instead. didn't realize it until i was using them & now i can't even return them!
missing item. i never recieved my order.
smells bad and doesn’t taste good. i don’t know how it works because my son hates it and i tried it in every single possible thing to mask the taste but he detects. he has been taking another fish oil without any probelm

"this taste horrible. i’ve used optimum nutrition for a good 6 years now, and i consider myself a loyal customer. i remember drinking this same protein 2 years ago and this taste completely different. it is obvious you have sold out and changed ingredients. you were once a company that placed quality over quantity and now it is the other way around. it looks like i will have to search for a new supplement brand for protein that is better quality for now on. i am pretty disappointed, the only thing i actually benefit from you guys anymore now is the optimen multivitamin."

"terrible. tastes horrible. didn’t taste like chocolate or caramel, more like coffee (i hate coffee)."
nope.. didn’t work for me at all. would not recommend.
"pills stuck together.. this is my first time leaving a review on ""x brand"", i've been a member for some time.i've used another brand on here, but decided to switch.all the pills are stuck together. don't know if they can be salvaged. never had this problem with the other brand...i managed to pull some apart from inside bottle(small hands), but that's not how the product should be presented/delivered. i would have to cut and destroy the bottle just to get them out to even give the product a try. other customer's reviews on this brand voiced the same issue. (see other reviewers post with pics)you'd think they would figure out how to prevent this from happening to their customers, repeatedly.i bought the product when i did so i wouldn't run out, so the hassle of having to mail it back and wait for another bottle would leave me without the supplement and the same thing might happen with the replacement. i hate when my time and money gets wasted. even if i managed to pull them apart, whose to say they won't be completely damaged and leak, therefore useless. not to mention the shelf life and integrity of the ingredients has probably been compromised because of extreme heat exposure, potentially making them ineffective.the pills i was able to take, are large, but that's never been an issue for me.they are soft and there was no noticeable or off putting odor.the other brand i used started to give me adverse effects (headaches, nausea, rapid heart), but with naturewise, i have not had any issues of that natrue, yet. (only day 2)product seemed promising.product is just not usable as delivered.maybe the company/""x brand"" should take it up with their shipping provider.maybe they could label their shipments to indicate a temperature (heat) sensitivity, so that is not left on a hot mail truck and left outside in the sun on one of the hottest days we have had this year. i could have been stuffed in my mailbox, but no, right on the front porch, directly exposed to the sun! yesterday, my delivery day, was the hottest day we have had in months in nc. it was at least 100 degrees on my delivery day.at the end of the day, this is something meant for human consumption, so temperature exposure should be taken into consideration and preventative measures should be in place. you wouldn't want you food (preserved or not) to be delivered that way, being ruined by the temperature before it even makes it in your door. same standard should apply for supplements...anything really, that is intended for you to consume.not happy."

not sure these helped!. bought for my husband. he said they did not work for him. he threw them away because they were smelling up the cupboard! i could not smell them though in the cupboard but from the bottle they did have an unpleasant smell
bad taste and scent. i had taken the nature made prenatal throughout 2 pregnancies and never had any issues. i found these postnatal and decided to give them a try while nursing my 2nd child. the reviews are true - they smell and taste much worse than the prenatal version. this isn't usually an issue that bothers me. i can swallow them and take them but it isn't as pleasant. i don't notice it after taking them though so i'll use them but wouldn't buy them again. i'm not sure what makes them so different from the prenatal.

"not working for me. i have very bad eczema on my hands. i have been trying to find anything that works to clear it up. i really wanted to like this because it is cheap and in general i like to support the ""x brand"" brand. however, this product just does not do it for me. maybe my eczema is just too severe for this kind of treatment but, all this has done for my skin so far is burn. it is sticky and leaves your skin feeling heavy, i already don't like that feeling but sometimes it is necessary for the heavy cream to really get in. but, this cream also burns my skin, not only on the open sores, which doesn't surprise me but also just my whole hand in general, has a burning tingly feeling that is uncomfortable and actually makes me want to itch more. i definitely don't want my eczema treatment making me want to scratch more then before i put it on. i can possibly see this as a daily application to keep eczema away but once you actually have it, it becomes useless."

products delivered damaged. gummies were melted.
"did the shells get harder?. we had been buying these for our dogs, who used to consider them ""fishy treats"" hidden in their meals.  they'd sniff them out and eat them first.  however, with this latest bottle, i keep finding them in their otherwise empty bowls.  i gave one to our 4-year-old german shepherd, who always loved them... she had to really bite it hard to break it up, unlike before.  that explains why our older dog can't eat them, and why the younger has also been avoiding them.  because they will no longer eat them, we've given up on this brand and have moved to nupro supplement instead, which is a powder that sticks to their kibble... no hard biting required."

"health kick sabotage. i have had so many different types of protein drinks and powders, this has got to be one of the worst. i am writing this review as i am drinking this horrible drink hoping that the foul flavor in my mouth will not scorch my taste buds forever. i received a sample of the vanilla and it is very gritty and chalky, almost mealy and the flavor reminds me of the taste of dirt, dry dog food or a combination of both.for something comparable, i prefer orgain powder and optimum nutrition. pure protein is okay in a smoothie with fruit. for ready to drink, premier protein, muscle milk, orgain, slim fast (i know, i never thought i would ever recommend slim fast), and atkins (only problem with atkins is it only has 15 grams of protein, boo!)stay away from this product, purely inspired and gatorade protein powder. those are the powders nightmares are made of and will make you fall off the health wagon fast than an burger, fries and milkshake."
"the pills gain moisture. pills are gaining moisture, becoming impossible to swallow"
"bad mix. always buy this brand but for some reason whether it bring old or stored in heat, this container i received does not mix well and like all the other ones i bought."
bad product!. i took this two days and had to stop. it makes you extremely gassy and i was itching all over my body. i can’t believe anyone would give this product five stars. i really wanted to believe the good reviews i read online but all i can assume is they must be fake and written by the people making the product. a real disappointment.
damaged. when i opened the bottle the security label was burned
damaged. when i opened the bottle the security label was burned
too sweet. i switched products and bought this one due to the added nutritional value.  i have been trying to stay away from too much sugar.although it has less then my last product this product also contains stevia.  had i know i would not have purchased it
fishy. very fishy especially the strawberry banana flavor. the orange and lemon ones are tolerable but i cringe when the strawberry banana one falls out into my hand for the morning.
"can't even look at them without gagging now.. i use several olly supplements and mostly like them a lot.. but.. i can't stand the taste of these collagen things. i figured i'd choke them down and finish the bottle since i bought it.. but i just took my 2nd one and i .just. can't. life is too short to torture myself. i'm going back to a different brand i was using. i've tolerated a lot of bad tasting supplements but i draw the line when i actually gag from it.  going to see if any of my family members want them so they don't go to waste. should be entertaining playing the "" this is gross! try it!"" game.i think i am forever scarred."

"good product, bad packaging. the ziploc is difficult to open and really poorly bonded to the bag. it broke apart after a few days of use for me. if you plan on buying this fiber product i suggest you have a spare container to store it in."

did nothing. it doesn’t matter how many i take. it does not make me sleepy at all. i’m better off not taking anything.
don't waste your money. doesn't work
yuck. first ingredient is sugar vitamin has terrible after taste
"way too big. like the make up of the vitamins, but the pills are way too big. i have stopped taking them since i can't swallow them even the ones i split in two. should be two pills per dose, not one."
bad batch?. enjoyed the first container i purchased and then reordered. i don’t know if they changed their ingredients but it doesn’t taste or look the same nor does it give an extra kick for a workout. pretty disappointed.
disgusting taste. this product is disgusting. i can barely get it down. it tastes like dirt mixed with a slight hint of raspberry lemon. i would not recommend this at all. i’ve had to go from 8 ounces to 2 ounces of water and take it like a shot just to get it down. it gets the job done in terms of caffeine level for a workout but man it’s the worst tasting pre workout i’ve had and i’ve tried many over the years.
not impressed. the product wasn't what i expected. it is very thin and doesn't mix well it gets clumpy. the flavor doesn't impress me either it just taste bland nothing ecxiting about it. i also am not seeing the results i wanted for it to be a mass protein.
too sticky and gooey. haven't used much because it's sticky. maybe i will learn a recipe to mix it with

i was sent the wrong item. i couldn’t figure out how o contact the seller so i figured i’d write a review. i was sent cane sugar instead of the b12 packets i ordered.
"try it if you have a sweet tooth. arrived in time, of course it does it’s work i feel fuller after having a cup of this protein. the only thing i don’t like is it is way too sweet that it stays on your tongue. i will buy this again but in different flavor this time."

poor quality control.. i have used this for years and even recommended them to my patients. not lately! they smell and taste so bad of fish. what happened to the quality control? i had to stop recommending and taking them myself.

might be okay for some people but i can’t take it.. i wish i could use this product. it makes me very sick to my stomach.
very bland to no discernible flavor. this product has been hyped as being an addition to flavor bland foods instead of using salt. it is very bland itself so i’m not feeling any positive reasons for using it. maybe i just got a bad batch but it hasn’t worked for me so won’t be buying it again.

something is disgusting with the one i just got. i have been buying this brand for a long time and all of a sudden the tub i got tastes gross. the after taste is horrible. never had this problem so i am wondering if something changed with the ingredients or something.
"not at all effective for me. i regularly use melatonin tablets to help me sleep, and they are very effective for me. i use the type that dissolve under your tongue, and they are very helpful in assisting me with falling asleep. this was the first time i have ever tried a gummy product containing menatonin to help me sleep, and it will also be the last time. these ""nature's bounty optimal solutions gorgeous sleep"" gummies did not make me the least bit sleepy: not even a little bit, which was so disappointing! also, i'm not sure why this product contains collagen.. i think it's a marketing ploy to charge more, honestly. i was so disappointed with this product and went back to my old standby form of melatonin after a full week of giving these gummies a try every single night. if you have never used melatonin before and are considering incorporating it into your sleep routine, i highly recommend trying the ""fast dissolve"" tablets before using a gummy product like this. the gummies may be a bit faster and more convenient to use, but they did not work for me whatsoever. the only positive thing i can say about this product was that the gummies taste amazing. however, this was of little consolation to me when it was 4am and i was tossing and turning all night long and could not fall asleep. i do not recommend this product!"
will cause dandruff. did not work for me. used it for more than 3 months and it just made my scalp dry.  now i am working on my dandruff.
wrong flavor sent. love the product but i have tried twice now to order the chocolate & they are sending me vanilla? really do not care for the vanilla would love the chocolate. not sure what’s happened since i’ve ordered this multiple times before.
damaged/missing product and shipping box damaged. i received the box damaged and one bottle was missing and one was only half full from spelling the contents inside the box. this was going to be a subscription. i will be cancelling!
cannot take risk of swallowing glass!  poor packaging!. broken glass makes this inedible.  shipper did not wrap this in bubble wrap and the glass bottle broke!
"does not dissolve. ""stir for 30 seconds until product dissolves.""  this literally never dissolves.  if you enjoy chewing your protein ""powder"" to the feel of gel-like tires, then you'll definitely enjoy it.  otherwise, absolutely disgusting.  return process is a breeze though.  thankful for that."
tastes awful. all i taste is nasty & i have tried several brands.  thought i would give this one a try and sorry i did.
"not super effective. have gone through the whole bottle. tastes good, but i haven’t noticed a big difference in my nail strength or hair growth like i was hoping. most likely will not rebuy."
durability. very poor quality bags
tastes like tour regular protein shake and it’s not good. if you like the feeling of “eating your protein shake” then this is for you. tastes like your regular protein shake. its off putting.
can’t get past the chalky texture.. i’ve heard and read great reviews about this company and i really wanted to love this mix. i just couldn’t finish my first and only shake it was far too chalky for me. very disappointed that i paid too much for this product only to end up in the trash.
"i had fish burps. i did not get fish burps all the time, but more than i care for."
"not easy to swallow. i need this vitamin, it came highly recommended by ""x brand"" users, but it gets caught in my throat. i tried crushing it, but would stick to my tongue leaving a film that tastes like cardboard. since i only need it daily it’s going to take forever to use it up."
does not work. does not work
"didn't work for me. i gave them to a friend. i bought for bruising and they did not help, at all :/"
bottle broken! bottle not properly protected during shipping.. i opened the package and the bottle is broken and all of the oil is gone. glass is in the bottom of the bubble wrap. please resend and add more shipping support. bottle has never been opened.
"not good at all  the  first  n the last one  very very bad product ,,  uffff nasty. dislike at all,"

as of 4/9/19 i have not received this order!. i know i am at an apo but its been about 5 weeks it shouldn't take that long.
"not for me. for some reason i feel bad giving these only 3 stars... i really wanted to like them.i was on the search for an affordable diaper i can use for my 3 month old during the day to possibly save money so i don’t use the pampers swaddlers constantly. i’ve tried a lot (up&up, luvs, huggies, cloud island, etc) and most of them end up give my little guy a diaper rash or don’t absorb the liquid breastfed poop well enough and leak everywhere. these mamabear diapers are just the same. i didn’t feel like they absorbed the pee and poop as well as pampers or even huggies. it definitely didn’t wick away poop moisture from his butt and it often leaked through the leg holes and up the back because of that. and it gave my little guy a diaper rash unfortunately. and i don’t like the design of the front part of the diaper- it’s hard to explain but it’s not contoured to his hips with flaps on the front that would wrap around his waist, there’s just a lot of diaper material that seems to have to be shoved between his legs which seems uncomfortable to me.couldn’t even keep using these because of the leakage and rash problem, had to return. for a similar price i prefer huggies or costco brand diapers."
"big blob. i received them today, and they are a big blob of gummies. they are all stuck together and melted. would not order again."

empty package. there is literally nothing in the package...there is a tear on the side of it...it appears to be intentional
you have to take 2 tablets 3 times a day.. i will be giving this away.  too much commitment taking 2 pills 3 times a day with meals.  and when you miss creatine you loose the effect.  powder form which you take once a day is way more convenient.
"leaks, diaper rash and poor product quality. not a good alternative for our usual brand of diapers. the absorbency and leak protection is poor. the overall quality of this product is poor, diaper unravels and doesn’t do a great job of keeping dry."
toughen after time.. medicine flavor. also get tough after opening for a few days.
"broken cap when received but good flavor. i received this product in the mail exactly a week ago, when opening it up, i was excited to start adding this sweetener to my everyday routine. when i opened up the package, the cap on the bottle was broken off, no where in the package did i find the broken cap, the seal was also ripped off, i was pretty disappointed... other than that the flavor is great, i use it in my tea every morning, but without a cap, i keep a plastic wrap over so it doesn’t fall and spill everywhere, which is very inconvenient."

"muscletech muscle builder. of course everyone’s metabolism is different and you might have great results with this supplement. personally i just didn’t like the queasy, groggy hung-over feeling in the morning.  it could be too much melatonin for my system or the valerian which can have some side effects.  nevertheless, it’s not for me."
"i got screwed. contents arrived all stuck together. i can't consume this, and even if i could i wouldn't want to. the vendor initially had them in a non temperature controlled environment."
"this article is about to expire july 7, 2019.. this article is about to expire july 7, 2019. i buy it a bottle for prolonged use so it does not work for me. it is not fair that you buy this article and can not use it because it expires in a few months.  this items with an upcoming expiration date must be removed from the warehouse, with the aggravating factor that it is a medicinal product"

"nice gummies, but my son doesn't like the flavor. i'm happy we can find gummy options for just about every supplement these days but my son does not like the blueberry flavor of these gummies."
"product needs a lot more protective packing!. bottle was leaking inside box, had to toss.  photo shows leak and there was only minimal packing around the bubble wrap on the bottle. leak was on the inside of box, too.  very disappointed."
"broken bottle, sickening odor, no reply from seller. i ordered 1 bottle of patchouli +2 bottles of bergamot. on delivery, i discovered that 1 of the 2 bottles of bergamot was completely broken. the scent of bergamot was everywhere, overpowering & sickening. weeks later the bottles still reek of bergamot & are not usable. seller asked for email before posting a negative review. i sent email 4/25/19 with pics of the broken bottle. i got no reply!"
"decent pre-workout. bad flavor.. 2 scoops is one ""serving"". you need 2-3 servings for a good pre-workout, especially if you have any tolerance to caffeine. good overall but for hat you pay for 30 servings, you only get about 10-15. also, cherry lemonade is the worst flavor i have ever tried."

"great taste - only 11 in box?. i love this protein shake. it has great flavor and is all plant protein. only reason for two stars, and quite upsetting if you're on a tight budget, the box was short. i received the box - unopened - and there were only 11 packets in it when the box clearly says 12. may try buying from a different seller next time."
taste horrible. state horrible. my kids love their chewable probiotics and i have no problem them taking anything else but they wouldn’t come close to these ever again. i even tried crushing them up and putting them in water and still stare horrible. i tried one myself to see if it’s just them and nope. i started gaging right away too. now i’m out $20.
"mislead - was given solid tablets instead of capsuls. unhappy that these are tablets (solid) , not capsules. i cannot digest the tablets."
nasty overkill taste of fish. this vitamin has the worst fishy taste and there is an orange/yellow film that gets on your hands when holding a pill. it takes everything to get that taste out of my mouth. i’m halfway through the bottle now and i just can’t stomach it anymore. they are going into the trash and i’ll be finding a new postnatal vitamin. 🤮

"not vegan. was happy with this product until i learned that it was made from lanolin which is derived from sheep's wool. specifically it is collected from the grease of the sheep's wool after they are sheared, which is often a painful and stressful process for the sheep. why the hell this product lists all the ways that it excludes other animal products only to be derived solely from an animal product is misleading and frustrating to find out since i thought that this product was free from suffering by not including fish oil or gelatin. the manufacturers of this should feel ashamed at there advertising of this and the process through which it is made considering that d3 can also be made from lichen, a 100% plant based solution. why would i want a compound derived from grease of an animals hair?!"

decent gummies - very sticky. gummies have good taste and vitamin assortment but the gummies are so sticky - obnoxiously sticky.

review. it made me very sick to my stomach and dizzy.
"utterly disgusting. i don't know if it has been reformulated or what, but it now clumps like crazy and is utterly disgusting in flavor."
product cant use on face it burns and itches. not a good quality this product burns
did not receive. i never received this product.
"disappointng. shower body wash without a pleasant fragrance, or cleaning power. just as bad as a dollar store body wash purchase."
"constipated. the gummies did help me sleep much better. however, shortly after taking the gummies i became very constipated. if you have stomach issues already, these may not be for you."
unacceptable bad name brand!!!. this brand is terrible and just realized i bought the same name brand detergent that almost all leaked out in the box they shipped it in.
similar to generic store brands but not up to par with pampers. the diapers were not as good quality as pampers. once wet the absorbency beads would somehow come out of the diaper and stick to my son’s skin. and the cotton like material would stick to his skin as well.
"poor return and contact information.. the did not send what i ordered. they have a gluten free product that is clearly described as gluten free, yet sent me a product that is milled in mills that process wheat, soy etc making it full of gluten. there are no links to contact the seller or any mechanism for returning the product. i would not recommend doing business with company. i have lost $50.00."

"seal was broken, but best flavor available. the reason i bought it? it doesn’t have sucralose in this flavor, but the seal was broken. ""x brand"" refused to accept return or send me other item. good product."

"horrible taste!. i've used this whey protein for years mostly the dark rich chocolate.  i decided to try the chocolate peanut butter and it was a big mistake, never again.  in order to tolerate the taste you need to mix in natural peanut butter or some other mixture to mask the flavor.  whomever designed this flavor, should be fired.  i will continue to use on whey protein but not this flavor."
wrong product. i ordered a organic product but they have sent me a wrong product.
"taste like play-doh. and i'm not that picky.. i was so disappointed in the taste of this because i've been looking all over for an ""all in one"" protein shake with probiotics, fiber, and of course, high protein. i don't care whether it's vegan - i have no dairy sensitivity, and i usually use whey protein powder, but i can't just blame it on that because i have tasted pre-made vegan protein drinks and been perfectly happy with their taste. this one (the chocolate) taste like play-doh. no, really. except it's not as tasty as i recall play-doh tasting because it has a horrible aftertaste. no, i don't love stevia, but i've eaten enough things with stevia in them that i did like to believe it can be masked sufficiently. maybe another flavor is better, but in my mind, it's not worth the risk at such a high price point to end up with another product that i can't even force myself to finish one serving of."

bad. fingers go through bags and bag... no scent ….
"it works. but pick out better flavor. flavor is acceptable,  usually add fruits to enhance the flavor to make it better. mixing is  tricky,  need blender with ice, fruits to liquefy it, and avoid the over-thickness potential."
"no change. i take a lot of advil for chronic headaches, joint pain, etc. i got this to hopefully cut down on the nsaid usage. i've taken almost the whole bottle and haven't noticed any changes. might work for some people, doesn't work for me."

"needs better leak  protection. i never really put reviews on products but i felt like i have to share my experience with this diaper. fist of all i  love the design of the diaper and the packaging but when it comes to absorbing the urine and it sucks.  my daughter barely get the diaper rashes what other types of diapers yet with this one she gets them so easily also at night the  urine comes out of the diaper so she wets the bed every single night with the diaper on,  so much for leak protection.  overall i would not buy this diaper brand again"
didnt like. gross could not get it down
didn’t work for me. didn’t work for me
wrong product sent. i ordered choline & inositol and received omega-3 mini gels instead.  not even close.

horrible diapers. i would like to get my money back i can’t even use these diapers. my daughter blows out in these diapers so bad! even her pee leaks out a lot! we’ve ruined many outfits wearing these diapers:( i’m sad because i got a ton of them and we can’t even use them.
"no iodine. these are delicious for all the good that'll do you -  compared the ingredient list to my previous prenatals, noticed the 150 mcg of iodine was missing, and called my ob who informed me that was a dealbreaker (especially if you have a history of thyroid issues). oh well. i'd recommend checking with yours before you buy these."
"socks instead of capsules. ordered capsules and socks showed up.  dont know if its the seller or ""x brand"".  but ya'll need to get it together.  mayber you're getting too big and need to scale it back.  getting very sloppy lately."
taste is awful. i have been using whey  protein powder and bought this based on the additional nutritional value.... what a mistake.  this is the most nasty tasting protein powder i have tried to date.  i couldn't even stomach more than one swallow.  i will never buy this product again.
"organic great, but. i really wanted to like this.some reviews didn't, but i wanted organic.this has a weird almost chemical taste to it.my reg organic meijer brand didn't & i cant find it anymore.won't be giving this to the little one.i can see non organic having a chemical taste.not this."

nothing. i don’t like the show big rollersand when you open the box there are so small rolls
sent wrong product !. [[videoid:49e73a56bd847fa43f76c0e72d371f70]] i actually can not give this product a review because they did not send me the correct product. instead i got a bottle of organic digest + chewable enzymes. i was going to eat my money back but i decided to read up on it first and it actually might be something that i never knew i needed . i have hypothyroidism so the enzymes in my stomach don’t digest food the way that it should which could lead to “leaky gut” so these might actually help and i’m willing to give them a try .
would of been a great product otherwise. recieved damaged
disappointed. the box was crushed and 1/2 of the cookies were crushed.
"weak tea, save your mondy. i was initially exited when i saw that ""x brand"" was now carrying their own brand of english breakfast tea; however that excitement quickly turned to disappointment when i tasted my first cup to the tea.  it is not a brisk or strong taste at all.  i found the tea flavor to be so weak that i had to add a lipton tea bad to my cup just to get the taste i expected from breakfast tea.  i will not be purchasing this brand again for breakfast tea in a k-cup."

"do not buy these!. as a 50 year old, i can tolerate most things. however, this was the most disgusting flavor i have ever put to my lips. i thought my 20 year old was exaggerating about the bad flavor and tried one. i gagged for at least 5 full minutes. disgusting would be a positive word."

disappointed. fragrance is so weak. ive bought other now essential oils and was satisfied. i will not buy patchouli oil from them ever again!
good buy.. honestly you could fill the bottle up a bit more. flavors great and i enjoy the kick it gives
don’t buy. charged me and never received the product!
not good for me. did not like it
none. it was opened when the driver dropped it on my porch.
nasty smelling oil and ineligible for return. buyer beware! this oil absolutely stinks! when i was a kid my grandmother had stuff she put on cuts and such....i believe she also cleaned with it. it was called germtrol. this oil smells just like that. gross!  i tired to return it and found out the product is ineligible for return. i will not buy this brand again since they apparently don’t stand behind their products.

"save your money - not shipped cold. my last order of this product was shipped without any cold packs even though it stated its supposed to be shipped cold in order to keep the product active… so i called and informed them and ordered a replacement and the second product was also a shipped in just a plain envelope without any cold pack.  it was 85 degrees today and left outside by my door - so now the 2nd shipped product is also useless.  save your money!!!!  ordered this product in the past and it’s always been shipped with a cold pack and never had any issues i’m sure it’s a distributor problem… but ""x brand"" customer service was informed and didn’t make any corrective actions."
was 2mg not 4mg wrong product. got the 2mg the pic said 4mg. dissapointed!!!!
"causes painful bowel movements!. maybe it’s just my gastrointestinal system, but these capsules wrecked me! i gave this 2 stars because i don’t believe there was anything wrong with the quality, i just think that maybe my body can’t handle the capsaicin. i am a regular consumer of very spicy foods but these capsules brought a new meaning to a burning bowel movement. beware! not recommended for anyone sensitive to chili powder or spicy foods."
fake. something is very wrong with this. it may have been knocked off and cut down? flavor is half of what it usually is and it didn't have the on sticker seal or the freshness seal under the cap. something is very wrong with this!

stale. i generally like these bars and liked the convenience of ordering subscribe and save but these were old and stale
"sneaky practice. it's 50 caps (2 pack) instead of 100 caps (2 pack) , the description is misleading, over priced, very dishonest seller"

seeds after over a week havent sprouted.. not good
perfect till they run out too fast get stuck together why?. i alway pull 2 or 3 tissues they get stuck together why?
would return if they would take it. made both me and my husband nauseas.  even when taken w a meal irritated our stomachs.
flavor and quality is not good. i'm using optimum nutrition gold standard 100% whey protein powder from a last 2 years and i know how it tastes but i'm not feeling the same taste from a packet. i think the product is not authentic.

don’t buy!. product arrived warm with a warm cold pack! we received it just as it was delivered. won’t contact me back for a refund.
burned my scalp. caused irritation where i applied to my scalp.  highly irritating to skin.
"no difference. honestly, i just don’t think these work. usually when i start taking vitamins i can feel them working. esp with prenatals you can see your nails and hair growing like crazy. the taste and texture is pretty bad but i could have gotten past that if i felt they were working."

"just okay.. garden of life products are an absolute favorite of mine. my family and i have been long time consumers of this company's vitamins and supplements including the vitamin code raw prenatal vitamins, the mykind organics men's whole food multivitamins, the vitamin code kids' whole food multivitamins, the raw protein and greens, the raw vitamin c, and the raw vitamin d3. i would enthusiastically rate all these products at 5 stars, so i was really excited to try this cbd+stress relief herbal supplement. i am sad to say that i feel garden of life has missed the mark a with this one. although i do feel the product is very reliable in regards to manufacturing, sustainability, 3rd party testing, etc., the effectiveness is sub par. any relaxant capabilities of this extract is subtle at best. at 15mg per serving, i do feel the overall amount of cbd is low. although this is reflective in the price of the product, what good is it if it doesn't help in the way it claims? also, the flavor is nowhere near palatable. for me, it is almost gag worthy. there is a spiciness combined with the sweetness of mint and stevia that is just terrible and the worst part is that the flavor is lingering. i will continue with the other supplements from garden of life that i am so fond of, but will stick with other and better cbd extracts that i've tried."

product seal was broken. the seal was broken and it leaked into the box.  this was a replacement for an order that never came.  i'm disappointed because i love the product
if you want to potentially feel awful and waste money then try this one!. i tried taking this at bedtime but wake up often with bad headaches and episodes of feeling anxious. the next day i just feel super exhausted like i’m on a benadryl hangover all day long. i couldn’t shake the fatigue. i would not recommend this at all!

"very bad return policy.. if i didn't open it, why i cannot return it?"
ugh. well you will probably lose weight from this because you'll be nauseous as you drink it.... be aware this has to be the worst tasting shake mix i've ever tried

fishy taste!. i bought these bc they have the exact same ingredients in the same order as the olly prenatal gummies and are cheaper for the same quantity. but these taste awful!!!! the texture is horrible too.

very sweet. watermelon was so sweet i had to use only half recommended amount. that being said i did not have to add any other fruit or sweetener to my smooth. i think next time i would try an in flavored version

"poor shipping packaging. tissues are so so. fast shipping, but at the expense of most of the boxes inside."
worthless. a men’s multi that contains soy. didn’t realize until i opened the package. will never purchase again.
damaged container during shipping.. the top of the container was broken when i opened the package. the jar of agave was only packaged in an envelope. i'm disappointed that this item cannot be replaced.
"good for the price. like the nutritional ingredients, but flavor is only tolerable if you add your personal touch."
"bottle is not the same shape as the picture. dislike the shape of the bottle, different than in the picture.  the bottle should be flat as i'm accustomed to, not round!  doesn't spray easily as a flat bottle does.  very disappointed!!"
overall very nice wipes. i care givers use these daily and have for quite a few years due to my paraplegia.  recently my orders contain 1 or more packages that are not properly sealed (open) on 1 end or the other. they are dried out on the end of the package and consequentially can't be used.just thought that i should bring this to others attention.
not good for me. i have allergies with the onion

no smell but bad morning sickness. mine were not smelly or oily but as soon as i started taking them week 4 i’ve been having bad morning sickness with all day nausea and vomiting. now at 12wks i’m still having bad morning sickness. with first baby my nausea didn’t last that long but i was taking different prenatal. i am switching because i feel better when i don’t take these.

"bitter apple peel. they look great and the price is right, however, this flavor taste obviously artificial with a slight bitter after taste."
recipe change. why did you change the recipe? it tastes terrible now. you lost me as a customer.

"not unscented 🙁. i’m sure this is probably good quality but the smell kept me from using. kind of chemical smelling. i should’ve stuck with the lavender scent, it’s much better."

"meh... chalky taste!. i’d have to say this protein is pretty chalky- i’ve used whey gold premium for awhile now but they changed the flavor of the chocolate, so it’s now has a slight little cinnamon kick to it that i wasn’t fond of, so i decided to try this hydro whey instead. it is nice that protein amount is higher in this version of the whey protein, but the turbo chocolate has a super chalky after taste. for a more expensive whey for 3/4 of the size of the other one, i’ll be switching back."

not fresh. received expired drinks!
one star. if you suffer with a lot of allergies do not take this vitamin.
did not do anything for me.. did nothing for me.
do not buy - received expired product. do not buy- i received a bag of pine nuts that expired 11/18.  this seller should be ashamed that they shipped something that expired over 6 months ago! i wish i could give this zero stars!

"caution. i searched vitamins for a while, and this product came out on top as the best for heart health. i took one in the am and ten min later i threw up and felt sick all day. if you have a jitty belly, i would not recommend this product, or you could try eating first and take on a full stomach. i did not try this so i gave them away because i was afraid to take another. my friend that i gave them to had no reaction and was fine."
"frequent buyer. not a fluke. always leaks!. i wonder what’s wrong with these pills. we like soft gel supplements. so we’ve been buying this liquid vitamin complex for a while, but now i’m going to move on and get something else. i can count on my fingers the times the flask came with the soft gels whole. it’s a mess and if you put them in your pill box they stain every other pills in there with oily, smelly, sticky  liquid. when this happens you have to put the pills in a bowl and wipe them clean one by one before sticking in your pill boxes. how come  now coq10, country life phosphadidyl choline,  nordic naturals ultimate omega, nature made super b complex or naturewise vitamin d3; all of them soft gels as well,  never leak? i don’t recommend"

product. i never received the product.
don't waste your money. bottim line didn't work
"good daily cleanser, no help with acne.. this is an average product. it is fine for sensitive skin and does not dry the face out. my teens and i have been using it for several weeks. it does nothing for acne. no improvement at all, but not worse either. it’s good for maintaining a clean face but if your looking for an acne wash to improve acne i’d spend some more money and go with a known brand proven to work."
"leg cramps returned the same day. i take magnesium to compensate for the magnesium used up by my gerd medicine.  if i don't take any i get leg cramps.  i just switched to sundown because it is a familiar brand and the price was very reasonable, but even at a higher dosage the cramps returned the same day.  i'm guessing that is because this is an oxide formulation.  judging by the reviews it works well for others, but it sure doesn't work for me."

"not so great. i bought this in preparation for vsg surgery, and i found the taste and texture to be acceptable, if a bit gritty...after the surgery, however, i found the taste to be very chemical-ish and unpalatable, and i know it was me that changed and not the powder. it is decent for the price, and i cut it with other powders to minimize the flavor, but i won't be purchasing again."

do not buy way too thin. way too thin. will not buy again. waste of money. going to buy ziploc bags to use for items that need something more sturdy than this
"not good ingredients. the ingredients are not good quality, it’s made from vegetable oils."
"these are not 1000 mg capsules. i used to receive 1000 mg capsules.  the last 2 times i ordered these i have received 500 mg capsules with the instructions to take 2 per serving.  the new capsules are smaller, but in order to reach my prescribed dosage of 4 g per day, i now need to take 8 capsules.  i am paying the same price but these will only last half as long.  i have no issues with the product itself but the description: ""optimum nutrition l-glutamine muscle recovery capsules, 1000mg, 240 count"" is misleading.  there are 240 of the 500 mg capsules."
"not as effective as other brands. i have a redundant colon which in turn has caused a chronic constipation problem. i take magnesium daily to promote bowel movements and while this particular brand of magnesium does an *okay* job, i've had much more success with other brands in the past. on other types of magnesium i would take about 500mg and have no problem, but sometimes with this one i need to take upwards of 1000mg to even have a chance of seeing any result at all. the fact i need to take so much of this type kind of cancels out the money i saved. i've noticed a lot of reviews from people who use magnesium for the same purpose and i would recommend sticking to a brand you already know works well for you."

"upset my stomach. it's ok - the 1000mg seemed like a great idea for my candida and overall sinusitis, but it upset my stomach on the 3rd day of use, even if taken with food - it would take days for the dull ache (slightly to the left/under the stomach) to go away. i'd rather take the 600mg nac with selenium/different brand formulation that never messes up my gut."
"hard to chew. hard to chew, gets stuck in my teeth.  not a soft chewy."
"never received. never received my package.  ""x brand"" had to refund me."
"not good packaging. unfortunately these did not come as they should have. they were meshed together and yucky. i love the product but ""x brand"" has not perfected how to send the packet form. i would suggest only ordering the hard shell package. ""x brand"" was nice to attempt to send again but i had to go through the trouble sending the first back and the second came like the first."
"smaller than expected. my fault that i did not read carefully. this was a much smaller bottle than i anticipated. could have twice the amount  at same price from big box store. the good news is that i like the smaller bottle, not so heavy and easy fit for arthritic hands, so all was not lost."
isn't the good stuff. isn't the good stuff & the watermelon tastes terrible.  will be ordering something else
"not as advertised!. this is advertised as the cherry, berry, and orange flavor, but it is not. when i opened my box i found that they sent me the assorted flavors gummies. this was not what i wanted. the cbo flavor is what i usually get because i have a very specific diet and need the specific nutrition. the cbo has different nutrition facts than the assorted flavors. our nearby walmart stopped selling the cbo flavor, so i don't know if it's discontinued and they only sell the assorted now, but i would have preferred to receive an email informing me of this so i could have the chance to cancel or change my order instead of open it to find that my usual diet guidelines are now all messed up. i have a health condition and can't easily deal with unplanned switches like this."

"will ship you old products!. product had a best before date of 3/2019,  i received it march 28th.  that gives me two days from delivery before stale date to consume."
"chalky. first times using this product, it had a chalky texture and taste to it. definitely did not taste like vanilla. i even tried adding more than the recommended 8oz that didn’t not help.  i would not recommend this product to anyone."
bad seller. when it was delivered the expiration date was one month left..

"hard on stomach.. this product always gives me terrible acid indigestion. i've tried them 2 different times with 2 different pregnancies.. same outcome. if you already get acid reflux and heartburn stay away from these, they make it even worser."
does not work!. did absolutely nothing to aid in sleep.  couldn’t return!
".... i really liked these for awhile until this order. i set them in my pill organizer and the next day they ended up like this with an awful taste to them. the pills still in the bottle are ok, but what’s the point? needless to say i haven’t taken them again.i’d love to write a better review in the future, but this is not pleasant at all currently."

"low scent, but lathers well. a good amount for the price, its pretty big and should last a while. there is no real scent to the body wash, however, it lathers very well and it rinses clean without any sticky residue. i have sensitive skin and was glad that i didn't have any reactions to this soap."

"be careful what vendor / seller you order from. i never write a review. but this was just unprofessional. i have been ordering c4 for many years. therefore my review is not about the product. the product works amazingly, i am a runner therefore i love the energy it gives before a workout. my concern is the vendor and or seller.... for which we purchase our product from. the jar was open, the powder was all over the box, mind you it was packaged well. we threw the product out, because of fear it had been tampered with. i am not sure what happen. we tried to call and make a complain but was unsuccessful, again because of safety these days, you just never know.... we got rid of the total ""x brand"" box.  we do feel the seller should make it right with us, and send a replacement or refund our account if this was truly and miss opened can placed in a box. just be careful what sellers you order from. c4 is an amazing product!"
taste is ok.. it's just a mediocre pre-workout in my opinion. i wouldn't buy it again. taste is a little off with some strange aftertaste that lingers...makes me feel a bit off also.
not soft. tissues not soft. scratchy.
bad ingredients !. very upset to hear a vegan product such as this would have horrible ingredients such as metals and arsenic . what a way to scam people ☹️
"all stuck together. my order of three pack arrived and when i opened the first bottle the gels were stuck tight together. to take the pills i had to bang the bottle on the side of the counter many times then used a baby silver spoon to stir around and pry some out. i was hoping to have better luck with the next bottle but when opened, it was all stuck again. since the baby spoon is the only one that fits through the neck of the bottle i am continue my bang and stir and pry loose routine. i am no  longer hopeful that the third one will be ok. in fact i can lay bets that the pills will be stuck together, similar to its mates in the other bottles.i am now shopping for another brand."
"not the better variety of glucosamine. this is hcl, not sulfate.  pills are huge and hard to swallow."
bad. tastes horrible
bad. tastes horrible
"came opened, unbearable smell. came opened, lost around 20-30 servings.every time i open it my entire room smells like expired cat food. unfortunately i got the biggest serving size and am now stuck with it.definitely my last product from this company"

"costuner service issue. item was not delivered even though online status indicates delivered!!!  ""x brand"" customer service not very helpful!i was told i have wait a full day after scheduled delivery date to report????"
"do not buy from this vendor. delivers inferior item. ordered for ""new & improved"". delivered old version ""new"". received on third day. 19th ordered, received on 22nd.package torn on one side."
didn't work. idk if it was because i was waiting for it too work or i was anxious to see what it was going to do on my body. i found that it gave me anxiety and i couldnt sleep at night

"leaves hair with weird buildup. was traveling and needed shampoo and conditioner, so i picked up this set as it was the cheapest option at the whole foods near my hotel. i should have gone further down the road to another store. my hair (2b, thick, and usually takes a little more moisture or oil) was left with some strange buildup on it, heavy, limp, and greasy. i thought i must not have rinsed it all out, so that night i washed it again and rinsed very carefully. i could even feel the texture was odd when i was washing though, it did not feel normal, and it dried the same way. it smells nice but i'd be better off not washing my hair at all than washing with this. will return to the store."

not edible. awful taste.. tastes awful. do not buy. buyer beware--seller would not let me return. garden of life should value customer feedback and honor returns.

headaches. these gave me massive headaches. i know everyone is different but i never got headaches from a multivitamin before. gave this stuff away to a co-worker.
"awful smell after awhile..... the only complaint i have is the smell. it was not bad at first, but after awhile the smell is really bad. reminds me of soiled underwear. which makes me dread taking the vitamins and makes them hard to swole without gagging on the smell."

"unpleasant smell and sticky residue. i usually love now products, and i was happy to find this economical progesterone cream.  however, the cream smells kind of like ben-gay cream to me, (which is not the scent by which i wish to be known), and worse, it does not absorb well into the skin.  i found that it leaves a tacky residue that stays until one bathes, so that fibers from clothing and dirt stick to one's skin throughout the day.  i wish the formula was better."

torn bag. my rating has nothing to do with the product...product is good. however the bag had to be torn when it was put in the box because the box is in mint condition. i lost a lot of the product due to someone not paying attention to the bag being torn. probably won't order from here anymore.
"taste super weird. not sure how well they work, as i can't get past the taste! they don't taste bad, really, just weird. i can only take them a couple nights a week, but i'm trying to work my way up to every day so i can see what all the hype is about."

my order did not arrive. i never received my order
flavor is great but look at the ounces only 10 ounces disregard product canister size. product taste amazing! works great only downfall is the canister is tall i expected it to be more than half way full it’s a little less than half of the bottle.
not good. made thicker hair everywhere and breakouts. gross!

product and delivery. product is ok but not as good as always discreet.delivery says it was left in residence's mailbox. checked 5x. nothing!then checked the front door. a large box was left on the top step so you could not open the door.  usps needs to learn the difference between a mailbox and a doorstep.i have learned never to order anything that will be delivered on a sunday.

"this arrived unsealed and exploded in the pouch. i ordered this and it arrived with a broken seal and powder all over.when i opened the pouch it came in i ended up with powder all over me and my carpet.  not sure if it was packaged like that or just carelessly crushed by the ""x brand"" driver.either way it was a waste.i think for this product going to the store to purchase in person is a better option.at least it was for me"
"the worst stomach pain i have ever had. the pills smell funky, like they were subject to moisture or heat. then, i had debilitating stomach pain from these - doubled over in agony. no other brand has ever done that to me. i am sticking with the ones that come in individual blister packs. stay away from these!"
not good in iron. my doctor advice me to stop taking these pills because i was not getting enough iron. not buying these again

taste awful. usually i like no love the flavor of my olly gummies but this vibrant skin gummie is so horribly disgusting. it is so bad that i would risk choking on them by swallowing them whole than to have to chew. after a day or two i gave them up so i can't comment on the effects. i can't describe the flavor other than it tastes like something you should not eat! so disappointed.

poor shipping packer. no packing...surprised nothing broken
good product. awful flavor of it. i like c4 but this flavor is not good! i was curious but it has a bad taste and super strong flavoring as well. i don’t recommend

too thick and somewhat sticky consistency. it was thicker than expected like the other reviews. it left a little sticky consistency. we purchased it based on high reviews and being the #1 best seller. a little bit disappointed.

nope. not the one. didn't work for me. i took it for 30 days with no results. i even increased activity and consumed less calories. no change in appetite or suppression. weight stayed the same measurements didn't decrease at all. disappointed
"taste and grit was too much for me..... this stuff tastes pretty awful and doesn't blend/dissolve well at all.  it works ok and gives me a nice boost, but honestly, i don't like the grittiness or taste enough to power through it for the benefits."
"gummies melted together upon delivery. i love these gummies, i have bought them in-store many times. i noticed they were cheaper on ""x brand"" so i ordered them online. when the gummies were delivered i opened the box and there was a melted ice back inside and all of the gummies in the container were completely melted together. i was not able to return them either due to the items return policy.i recommend the gummies but i do not recommend buying them online."
"never received. although it shows like it was delivered to me, it was not."
"decent supplement bar. garden of life makes good organic supplements and bars. i’ve purchased the red berry bars froma local health food shop and really liked them. the price is high, so i turned to ""x brand"". chocolate supplement bars are hit & miss across all brands. garden of life is right in the middle. the bars have a slightly dry chalky-like taste, but it gets better after a few bites. you’ll definitely want something to drink with this bar. i ate these mostly as an afternoon lunch, accompanied with fresh fruit or as a dessert after a veggie salad. i don’t think they are filling enough for a meal replacement bar, but that’s my opinion. i’d definitely purchase from garden of life again, but choose a different flavor bar for variety."

"beyond expiration date. i received the chocolate dipped cherry product on march 27, 2019. the cake bites were hard and inside was brownish. turned out that the product was expired 05/05/2018. this is the second time i received expired product through ""x brand"". when i order directly from the manufacturer i never had this problem but they don’t always have this."
"kind of sort of comparable to cetaphil. i've been using cetaphil, per my dermatologist's instructions, since i was a pimply teenager.  i am now 43, and still use this every night to clean my face. i like that it is a gentle product that isn't irritating to my sensitive, acne prone, and now ageing skin.  critical to me are the fact that the cleanser is affordable, non-comedogenic, and fragrance freewhen i saw that ""x brand""'s brand solimo, created a similar gentle skin cleanser.  considering that solimo sells its cleanser for $2.00 less than cetaphil, i thought it was worth a try to determine whether it was worth a permanent switch.the consistency of the cleanser is very similar to cetaphil; it is a viscous, opaque soap that pumps easily from the bottle.  it is a gentle cleanser, therefore, it can be used with water or without.  when traveling without access to hot water, i notice that just rubbing on my face and wiping off with a washcloth works just fine.  with access to normal amenities, i always wash off the cleanser with warm water and towel dry.this cleanser can also be used with or without water.  i noticed a difference however, in that wen i applied th ecleanser to my face, i detected a slight stinging - nothing that would really be noticeable, but noticeable tome because i have never gotten that sensation with cetaphil.  the cleanser also dried my face out a tiny bit more than cetaphil.  again, a very small difference, but something i didn't really enjoy.i would definitely use this in a pinch if i was out of my regular cleanser, but i won't be switching products permanently anytime soon."
poor packaging led to broken container. it arrived cracked open and leaking everywhere. there is no option for return or refund. i obviously can't use it so i had to throw it away. :-(
"it was ok, not great or bad.. it did leave sorta an odd after taste.  i didn't notice that it gave me any more energy at all.  it was like just drinking a sugar-free fruity drink"
"breakouts. i’m not sure why, but this product made me breakout in tiny bumps on my face. it’s them same reaction i experience when i eat dairy (i’m allergic). i tried it for 1 month hoping the reaction was temporary, but i couldn’t bare looking at my face covered in bumps any more. luckily my face cleared when i stopped taking it."
expired product. i just received the product and it had a clear expiration date of 9/2017!
had to discontinue and toss after a week because it made my stomach hurt so bad.. it’s too high of a potency for long term use and it upsets the stomach so bad if you’re prone to that.

"packaging issue. i'm hoping my less-than-favorable review will affect this company's poor packaging methods. on this and other supplements of theirs, the foam top seal does not remove cleanly and has a thin metal layer that tears and small fragments could easily fall down into the jar. i'd like to give a higher rating, but for a big company charging a premium, i really dislike that attention wasn't taken to prevent fragments of foam and metal from entering the product as the top seal cannot be removed cleanly. i think that's ridiculous, and i am confident they could find a better solution that their customers deserve."

i must not like this stuff. did not like the taste
"works but bad quality assurance. i use this product to reduce inflammation from working out and it works great. the first bottle i got had no problems at all. however,  the pills in my second bottle were covered in a fine yellow dust (tumric) as if one of the capsules had burst. in combination with the black pepper, it makes the pills hard to take."
"bad taste & odor. if you take these right out of the bottle they may be tolerable in their awful taste and smell. however, if  you pack travel and weekly pill boxes you will find out these will stink up the whole box of meds, and transfer that smell and taste to other pills."

no effect. doesn’t seem to absorb in the system.
stick to your teeth. these have a weird texture to them and they stick to your teeth. i stopped taking them because of that.

tastes nasty!. tastes nasty! i waited to try this after it was too late to send back!
"too sour, too sweet. these gummies are very sweet, and very sour. personally i find the sweetness and sourness really overwhelming and don't like their flavor! otherwise they seem like a fine, albeit not as good as other brands, blend of vitamins and minerals"

"sticky, greasy residue left behind. i'm not impressed with this lotion for a couple of reasons. the pump does not work at all, so you have to pour it into your hands. it's a very thick lotion, but it leaves a slightly greasy residue behind on my skin. i apply moisturizer after my shower and before bed, but this stuff takes so long to fully absorb that i ended up with some on my pjs. i think there are much better options out there - the aveeno and sauve brands come to mind."

"product had been opened and compromised!. i am very disappointed with this order! the bottle was open! the clear plastic around the top of the bottle had been opened and the seal under the cap on the bottle itself was peeled back! totally unacceptable for a supplement! i would never take anything like that! god knows what someone could have put in there...this keeps happening with health and beauty products purchased from ""x brand"", and i’m starting to think it is better to order from the companies directly to be sure i’m getting what i ordered! this is definitely going back!1 star because there is not a zero star rating!"
horrible taste. extremely bad taste! don’t waste your money

"good for general cleaning but not for electronics...leaves residue. i used to buy the clorox wipes which i used for general purpose as well as to clean electronics such as cell phone, laptop, mouse, keyboard, etc.  those worked great.  i decided to give these a try as they are cheaper.  for general purpose these work just fine but when cleaning electronics, these leave residue and white particles.  so overall not a bad product but if you're like me and looking to use these to clean not just countertops then i'd stick with the clorox brand."

"just no! sticks to your teeth, gums and roof of your mouth.. so, let me start by saying that i need vitamins as i have digestive issues that require me to get my nutrients in forms such as lots of daily vitamins. well, gummy vitamins are my preference because, let’s be honest, they are just yummy! but these, uh, no! it’s not that they taste bad, it’s that they stick to your teeth, to your gums, to the roof of your mouth. well, i have to take four of these jokers each day - that’s great if they are a treat. that’s a punishment if it’s this brand. head my warning and take a hard pass on this one!"

very hard to mix in blended. too much powder not thin enough
"just ok. eh.. these have a really weird taste. they’re dense.. make sure you have a bottle of water to wash it down. i had the bbq flavor, which has a sharp and zesty flavor.. way too strong. the price point is also not very good. they sell 10 bags for 17.99. 12 bags for that price would be acceptable. but the mediocre taste..? eh. i’ll pass on these."

one star. i could not swallow the pill.  it got stuck in my throw.t
"very chalky and thin compared to other protein beverages. even with a blender and mixing with fruit/ice, it was very thin and chalky. the shake was not very sweet and did not cover up the ""greens"" well at all. if you were making a veggie blend, maybe it would serve as a better base but was terrible with fruit or as pb/chocolate. i previously ordered idealshake which was much thicker and sweeter. i was hoping this would be my new go-to because it was cheaper and had the ""super greens""."
"decent powder but packaging vs product amount is disappointing. i was looking for a very specific vegan protein powder when searching. i do like the ingredients in this protein powder however the taste is very chalky and filled with stevia aftertaste. i’ve made different shakes with different ingredients to see if the underlining taste changes and it does not. when it arrived and i opened it, it was not full of product. very disappointing in the look of how big the container is to then open it up and see such little product compared to size. to be a more of a honest company to your consumers i would suggest making the packaging match the amount of product. i take protein powder for what it is, it’s not suppose to be a delicious meal so i will continue to use the product and see if by the end of the container it has done what i set out for when i bought it.... adding more needed protein for my healthy lifestyle."
broken. i love this essential oil but i’m giving it 1 star because the item was broken & oil spilt every where. it was not packed well at all for a glass item.
didn't work for me. a friend swears by this product so i decided to try it.  did not have any benefit.
"the hormones made me write the review!. i tried these out after a year of trying a regular pill form and i was raving about them before i was pregnant and maybe the first few weeks i was pregnant. but once those hormones started to change, i would dread downing these things. just the flavor of the gummies were never appetizing to my stomach. maybe they would be better after the first trimester. but now at seven weeks i’m gagging my way through."
very misleading. not organic as advertised.

"item shows delivered -. tracking shows item was delivered, but package was not actually delivered until a day later.  it arrived though, so i upgraded from 1 star to 2 stars.  why 2 stars?  the cap to the bottle is totally cracked.  nothing leaked because the bottle was sealed, but had to reseal myself.  not worth the time and effort to return.  but at least it finally arrived."
yuck. it had very bad smell and test. not recommended at all.
yuck. it had very bad smell and test. not recommended at all.
"good just not great. it’s hard finding a great plant based protein and this one is good, just not great.. 2 scoops for 30g of protein. i drink my protein shake after every gym session (6 days) so i know i’ll be going through this fairly fast.. it also has a grain texture."
horrible after taste.. i originally ordered this product because all of the great reviews. at the first bite of the first gummy it is so chewy like soft soft gum and the taste is so horrible that i have to chase it down with a drink right after. if you're looking for a gummy with good taste this is not it.
"it’s synthetic and bad for u!. this is asorbic acid!! it’s a synthetic, mostly made from gmo corn, and bad for you!"
never received the product.. my american express was charged but i never received the product. order# 111-6750159-6241008
not good at all. won't buy it again. the flavors included were gross. and we love jelly belly.

"inedible. this stuff does not dissolve in anything, not even wine, and has the consistency of pine tar. a tablespoonful will make you gag because it sticks in your throat and cannot be swallowed."
"didn't work for me. miralax does the job. this stuff just didn't work for me. in fact, i tried two generic substitutes for miralax and neither one worked. at all. i take generic nexium, works like a charm. for some reason, my system doesn't respond to generic substitutes for miralax. based on the other reviews posted, it would appear that most people will get the necessary relief from this product. i just didn't for some reason."
"opened product. seal was broken and product was all in the ""x brand"" packaging when opened!!!"
"not even close.. well the claim that they are like neutrogena isnt true. sure, they're cheaper but not if you need to use three times as many. also, they are so dry that you're tugging on your skin to get the makeup off, so that cant be good either.as far as mascara goes, it's never coming off.save your money because this is not a good buy."
"blends well. flavor was too sweet, but blended pretty well."

buyer be aware. i had a bad reaction to these disposable underwear and i won't be buying or recommending then to anyone. i'm fact i have them to a family member and she also had a reaction to the but not as bad as the one i had. don't know what was wrong that two of us had some type of reaction the this product
no energy. the b-12 didn’t do anything. no improvement in my energy.

"overwhelming vanilla flavor. i've tried using less and less of this product in things that i make, and the vanilla flavor overwhelms everything. i endedup using so little of it, that the protein content was probably negligible!  if you are looking for a powerfully-vanilla-tasting protein powder, this one is definitely for you.  i bought it because i hoped it would blend into the background, but alas it does not!"
not a bioavailable material. this shouldn't be a magnesium supplement as mgo is not absorbed well and is pretty ineffective for magnesium deficiency.
not for sensitive skin. i used this on my acne oily sensitive prone skin. it did not work for me.  it caused itchiness after 5 minutes. after removing it my skin felt really sandy dry. it didnt help my acne.
"buy somewhere else!. purchased two bottles from ""x brand"" on separate occasions. in both bottles, oil from the pills had leaked out. the smell of fish oil was so overpowering that i couldn't stomach them. something is wrong with their process, like storage or handling. when i buy the same product from target i don't have these issues."
never received the order!. never received.
no label. i was very disappointed when i opened the box and got them out there is absolutely no label on the bottle so who do i know it’s the right vitamins i ordered. will not order them again.

"vega protein and greens is an acceptable product.. i like the fact that it is a non-soy-based product, but the flavor is not that great."
wouldn't get in the future. i have been taking these for about a month a this point and while i have not specifically seen any change or difference in my skin tone/texture/brightness.the softgel's are a small size and have no taste. they are easy enough to swallow and the color is quiet nice. at the current price of $17.99 for a 45 day supply i would not purchase this once i am finished with this set.
terrible taste. the flavor is not fruity as advertised. it’s terrible. if i could return it opened i would.
"all kinds of terrible. this stuff tastes disgusting. from texture to flavor, it’s god awful. purchased end of jan and still trying to finish it. its almost tolerable if you use 1/3 of serving in oatmeal if you add splenda and yogurt and cinnamon. if i could return, i would."

"misleading nutritional information, very disappointing. contains sugar alcohol, not listed on nutrition label but clearly listed in ingredients list (organic erythritol). very disappointed this company would have misleading nutritional panel by not clearly listing the amount of sugar alcohol in this product. after first day i was bloated and having tummy troubles bc i am extremely sensitive to sugar alcohol and avoid it at all cost! by 3rd day i raided my food to look more carefully and found this does indeed have erythritol, a sugar alcohol, in it. shame on this company for being so shady. i currently buy this brand protein powder too, and it doesn’t have any in it. i don’t understand why not just label it honestly.if you like to be bloated, gassy, cramped up and miserable, then eat up!! nothing tastes good enough to suffer like that, sure as heck not a protein bar."

open and broken capsules in the sealed package!. there were 2 broken capsules in the sealed container.  i was not pleased with the quality control.
"crumbly texture. not smooth and creamy; kind of dry and crumbly. this is similar to noxema cream, if you remember that old-fashioned all purposed eucalyptus cream. we used to smear it on for sunburn and wash teen-age faces to prevent acne. this stuff did not have a nice texture, unfortunately."

review. the flavor is good and you do get a lot in the bottle. i couldn't tell that it helped me sleep any better though
"good flavor. taste good, not sure of its effectiveness yet. i’ve been using this for less than a month, so maybe time will tell."
prime 1 day. tryed these out because the ones i usually get weren't going to get here for 5 days. i needed them on so i decided to try these. taste like candy orange slices. prefer the gummy.
terrible texture and flavor.. these tabs taste awful and the texture is not crisp at all. they are almost gummy in texture while being a chewable tab. very weird combination and the flavor makes you think you are about to get the flavor of pepto. would return if i could. will never buy again.

"the date on the product is important. i like this product, but was disappointed when receiving it in april 2019 and having the expiration date on the bottle as may 2019.  usually when purchasing a vitamin product, having the expiration date for at least one year is an indication of a fresh product."

"too hard to swallow. i may have to grind them or something. they are smaller than the natures way capsules, but so much harder to get down. they get stuck even when taking with big gulps of water. normally, i have no issues getting pills down-this is a first for me."
"sarna works much better for me. i've been using sarna anti-itch lotion for a few years now, whenever needed but not daily.  i thought this might be a much more affordable alternative.  the active ingredients are different.  this is a clear liquidy gel that needs to be shaken before use.  it doesn't show on your skin except for a shininess when it's first applied.a couple of days after i got this product, a spider or one of his buggy kin thoughtfully bit me so i could test this.  it may work differently for you, but for me and my spider (or whatever) bite, it didn't seem to do much.  it's worth a try to see if it works better for you because if it does, you can certainly save money, but i'm going to stick to sarna."

"okay. the rolls go pretty quick- not as good as the presto ""x brand"" brand."
yuck tasteless and too powdery. yuck one the worst i have tried. yes i have shaker bottle and it will taste better with milk. i was wanting to drink it with water only... on gosh it’s so hard to get down. lacks flavor and so chalky tasting.
didnt work for me.. these are huge! i took 4 a day for weeks and weeks. no increase in supply and didnt help much with blocked ducts.
"delivery problems. ordered product on 5/2, delivery was expected between 5/7 and 5/9. product never arrived so i sent a complaint to seller and ""x brand"" on 5/10. received new shipment information on 5/11. when i checked tracking details, saw it was not shipped until after the original delivery estimate. i suggest purchasing via prime where ""x brand"" can manage delivery."
"mixes easily. this is a granular type protein mix and it does mix readily.  i found the flavor to be just a bit ""off.""  it's also not very sweet.  the ingredients are great as is the high amount of protein you get in 1 scoop."

"i never received the product. i bought this product a few months ago and i never received it (the account in ""x brand"" it's saying ""it was handed directly to a receptionist or someone at a front desk."" but i never received it)"
very sweet. i find it is overly sweet. the isagenix protein shake has a better taste.
so nasty. i spit it out right away. literally vile and i would not recommend. go buy regular fish oil.
"sketchy. i have been taking this product daily several months. i started developing weird episodes of anxiety, chest tightness, and digestive issues at night (when i take my vitamins) and only recently connected the dots. i forgot to take my vitamins the previous night and felt great all day. then tonight within 20 minutes of taking my vitamins the extreme anxiety and chest tightness came back! this paired with the reports of mold by other customers tells me this product is not fit consumption."
"they changed the formula, eww. i dont know what changed. these use to be like a soft gummy now it's like a matte hard stale gummy. i ordered 2 and will return both and will have to officially change to q different collagen gummy after using this for about 2 years. they should include a ""changed formula"" label. just gross and matte like something that fell on the floor or is going bad."

something wrong with these!. have tried this and their other ultimate probiotic which is kept cold. i don't know if it's because these aren't a cold product and instead shelf stable if that is why they work differently but i didn't like these at all. they caused serious bloating and stomach upset issues....like out of nowhere you run to the bathroom or you won't make it type issues. even the men's version had the same problem for my husband. be careful if you dare to use these. we will go back to their cold ultimate probiotic one. this one is not worth it and something is seriously not right with these.
"bad taste, produced in china. we were disappointed with the flavor of these, quite bitter.  found out they're also produced in china.  will not buy these again"

dont recommend. taste was awful! very bitter. i bought in hopes to increase milk supply..it didnt work. i used in multiple recipes and ate it for weeks. no increase! and it made me super gassy.

"disappointed. this product did nothing for my muscle recovery and the worst part was, that it actually kept me awake instead of falling asleep. very disappointed in this product."
i would like seller to address the issue of the product came with loose cap. the bottle of wintergreen was not sealed. i could smell the oil in the mailbox before opening the box. the lid was not on fully and the product was spilled into the packaging. i also bought 2 more from now that arrived perfectly a day or so ago. the bottle is missing about a fifth of the oil and it doesn't even smell right. can i return it for a perfect bottle? this one had been opened and not sealed while the other 2 have lids that are fully tight and not loose. this one is missing a half inch of oil. i am not offered a chance to return it or have it replaced. there is no place to contact seller.
"taste and smells awful. i have bought the garden of life vanilla raw organic protien before from ""x brand"". my first container was good. this second container was awful. the powder was a darker color,  smelled nasty and tasted awful. and  when i put the powder in the blender it didn’t blend well. the powder would stick in the blender. and this shake was thicker.  i am wondering is this generic product."

"arrived melted!. i ordered olly gummies because i saw them in store but wanted to try different vitamins out through ""x brand"". i waited a while for them to arrive. i believe they might have been out of stock at the time of purchase. i was saddened when they arrived melted, even though it was sent with an ice pack. i ordered a few other flavors and they came fine, but the pro+pre-biotic one melted completely. i guess it might be best to buy these in store. i’ll be willing to change my review if the customer support responds."
"broken safety seals.... both were broken. returning the item. too bad, i really like these vitamins."
"broken safety seals.... both were broken. returning the item. too bad, i really like these vitamins."
packaging problem. product came without the lid. safety seal was peeled open. glycerin product was leaking out all over everything else i ordered. still trying to get a replacement. i keep getting a message stating “this product is non returnable”. i just want a replacement bottle.
taste awful. there was a lot of good ingredients in it but it tastes awful... i thought it would be better tasting and chalky
"defective piece. hi, received defective bottle it's getting leaked while using, bottle cap got damaged and oil was running out of it. please advise the next step."
"sent the wrong item, and it is non-returnable. the headline says it all.  i got b-12 instead of methylfolate, and can't return it."
"fast delivery!. product was delivered fast and was in very good condition when it arrived. the pills are somewhat large, but not unusual for fish oil. i found them easy for me to swallow and i experienced no aftertaste. potency and effectiveness are too early to tell at this time."

moisture in the sealed bottle and made a lump of stuck tablets. when i opened the seal of the bottle a lot of tablets stuck to each other. it looks like the seal is made of cheap quality materials. even though it is sealed  moisture might have entered the bottle. i don’t know the quality of the tablets.
made me very sick. this product made me extremely sick almost immediately after drinking it. it’s like my body hit the emergency evacuation button. not something you want to feel right in the morning. i took it as a am kickstart as claimed on the packaging. although upon opening it has a very strong and desirable cotton candy smell (like fresh from a carnival) the product does not taste like cotton candy at all. i was expecting cotton candy flavor like you taste in the bang energy. instead it tasted watered down sour taste. returning immediately.

not worth it. was a super good deal but wipes are dry. got them for my newborn but irritated skin because i would have to wipe harder
good supplement bad packaging. i ordered a 10 pound bag of strawberry and after getting close to the bottom of the bag i noticed hard lumps of protein. i don't know if it's mold but i am throwing the rest of this bag. i had my bag stored in the closet. dry and in a bag for 2 months

i plug my nose just to drink this. the flavor is so terrible i have to plug my nose. i don't know if i will finish this so i can't speak to it's results. might try to mix it with something else but definitely can't tolerate it on its own. if mixing doesn't work i'll just throw it out. for now it's just sitting on my counter til i work up the desire to try it again which who knows may be never. if you want just a simple post-workout shake try something else cuz it is not good. product arrived intact and as expected so it has that much going for it and the organic thing which is the only reason i gave it 2 instead of one star.

"tastes great!. the chocolate and chocolate peanut butter flavors are outstanding, and the vanilla is pretty good as well, though a little bland.i've used 15 pounds of this powder in the last 6 months.  i stopped using it after reading the independent laboratory testing conducted at the behest of the clean label project, however."
major leak product. too big and cumbersome. for major “leaks”....
"unbearably saccharine taste. i wanted a healthy non-animal protein to add to my diet because i have a temporary stomach issue and animal proteins have been making me ill. i hoped this would be a healthy way to get more protein in my diet & maybe help boost my fitness routine.alas, this tastes like someone insulted a cacao tree, ground it's raw fruit into pure stevia, then packed it as a powder. the flavor actually makes me more nauseas than the foods i was trying to replace. i will use the entire jar because that's how my momma raised me, but i'll never buy this again.0/10, would rather chew old leather shoes than taste this again."
these are not cake bites!. i really hate eating protein bars so when i saw `cake bites` i ordered 2 boxes.what a mistake.these are just optimum nutrition`s protein bars split into 3 round shaped bites.i was expecting an actual `cake` like taste and texture which these are not.i would not reccommend these for purchase unless you like your protein bars in smaller bites.how about some truth in advertising optimum nutrition?
"weak oils w/o safety seals..... i gave it two stars because they got here crazy-fast. however, i do have to agree with a lot of the reviews that these are, indeed, very very weak. and there was no safety seal on the bottles!!! eek!!"
"stuck together. i order other gummy vitamins with no problem, but i requested a replacement and the second bottle came with 1/4 of them melted in the bottom. won't be reordering."
"fish odor in bottle. they are fish oil so i guess that's given that they will smell like fish, that's fine. but this last batch the entire bottle smelled really bad, maybe one of them broke and leaked, not sure. i will find out soon."

"not going to buy it again unless they get a different flavor. i love that it’s a plant based d3 and it has omegas in it. but my family and i hate the taste. the b12 spray tastes good, kinda wish they did a citrus flavor with the vitamin d3."
"i love garden of life products, but this did nothing for my mood.. this a great probiotic for me and garden of life probiotics work excellent for my digestion. however, it did nothing to improve my mood."
gi upsets will happen. it does leave an after taste but not as objectionable as the supermarket sweeteners. however heed the warnings. it will produce diarrhea if not taken in small doses
"disappointed. says there would be no fishy taste, but i still experienced fishy burps yuck."
do not buy. made me vomit
"after two weeks, don't notice any difference. will not purchase again. pretty pricey with no noticeable difference in digestion or bms. i will try something else next."
sis not receive this order. i never received this order!
"nasty flavor get the mango. taste is nasty, doesn't work for me anymore, need to cycle"
"nasty flavor get the mango. taste is nasty, doesn't work for me anymore, need to cycle"
no real difference. no real effects
no dha. fyi this does not have dha in it (and you want that in your prenatal)! i like this brand but would not have bought this one if i had known.
tastes fine but made me sick. i was very excited to use this product but unfortunately it made me feel awfully sick each time i consumed it :/ i blended it into smoothies filled with things i normally eat that don't make me feel bad so i know it was this powder. maybe i got a bad batch? disappointed

"these do not increase dopamine levels in the brain. these do not work, i have a phd in neuropharmacology and can tell you without reservation that they have no meaningful effect on neurotransmitter levels in the brain.  please don't waste your money."
refund????!!!!!. if i could of given it a zero i would of.  i have taken melatonin for years.  recently started trying the liquid and i must say this is the worst one i've tried.  the last brand tasted terrible but worked great....this one tasted like water....and did not work at all!!!!! i think i could of drank the entire bottle and still been awake. very very disappointed

merchandise not received - nor sure where my order is but i didn't get it???. i'd like to know how to communicate with customer service about the fact that i did not receive this package.also had to choose at least one star in order to post this which makes no sense to me - why can't we have a customer service contact number or email.  the choices to correct the non receipt of package seems to be non-existent.
increase in hemoglobin. i've been taking the inositol once a day for about 2 months now. on a recent bloodwork panel my physician noted an unusually increase in hemoglobin. he did ask me to discontinue the inositol based on his research and the potential side effects.  was not aware of this result. probably should not have bought a 3 pack.
"doesn’t have folic acid!. i see that these have no folic acid in them? folic acid is crucial for baby’s neurological development, and a deficiency has been shown to cause a high incidence of neural tube defects and other neuro issues (such as spina bifida and anencephaly—things you definitely want to protect your baby from!) every pre-natal vitamin should include folic acid."
"good price, average lotion. this is good lotion, but pretty average. it's fine for normal applications, but maybe not as good as premium brands for dry skin. you do get a good amount for the money, though. i'd use this again for everyday uses, but for use in winter, i'll stick with cerave or the like."

i’d rather drink mud.... worst flavor i have ever tasted.
not good. not good shampoo
"could be fine fiber, i don’t know. i bought this product for my dog at a vet’s recommendation because her anal glands have to be expressed monthly. gave her diarrhea. might be fine for other uses. i have no way of knowing"
"item was as described.. excellent service right on time, item was as described. too expensive"
taste awful. i don't recommend this favor
not sealed. the plastic sealing film was broken and tahini was leaking down the side of the jar when it arrived.
"sketchy product quality checking. i love this salsa when i purchase it from costco. i ordered it once here and it was fine, but the second time i ordered it the seal was broken on one of the bottles with crusty dried salsa all around it."
"mediocre diaper. nice fit and good absorbency, but doesn't hold up overnight without leaking. also no good for my daughters' skin. caused irritation in both my infant and toddler, even with frequent changes. i'm switching back to target up and up. those have never irritated their skin."
you may not ever receive it. too bad i never received it. this seller charges more for kirkland brand by over $6.

awful smell from the tablets. i did their thing to get the second bottle free. i had not finished the first bottle when i did so.  but something must’ve been wrong with some of the tablets in the bottle because the smell was awful. it smelled like some sort of nasty perfume and i was pregnant and it caused me to get very sick from it. i use pill containers to take my vitamins every day and it even ruined the pill containers. i’ve taken many vitamins in my life and i’ve never had something like this happen. i normally don’t write too many reviews but hopefully i can prevent someone else from having this awful experience.

"would not buy again. i think this product is okay...but i can not use it because the smell is horrible! it feels like all other caster oils that i have bought and is a nice feelings oil for dry skin, but the odor almost gags me and stays on my skin for hours. i love what caster oil does for dry skin but this one missed the mark because of the odor."

well worth the money. 3 scoops in 10-12 ounces of water and watch out. great flavor.
"deceptive labeling low protien per serving. this huge 6 lb can of powder only has 8 servings as broken down on the label. super high sugar, sodium and carb content vs protein.  better off with a high protein, low carb alternative. shop around."

"okay flavor, but texture is hard to stomach. as a vegetarian (not vegan)who recently started a boot camp workout routine, i’ve been looking for extra ways to supplement my protein. i’d previously been using isopure zero carb, but the whey was starting to irritate my stomach. i found garden of life raw protein at my local lucky’s market and decided to give it a try since i love chai flavor. a quick peak at the ""x brand"" rating showed 4 stars, and they had individual serving packets that would let me try without committing to the tub, so i figured why not. once i got home, i started reading the recent reviews and was a bit less confident. tried it anyway. while the flavor isn’t bad, the texture is so difficult to stomach. like... it’s really bad. have to choke it down bad. it mixes okay (no heavy chunks of powder or anything), but is so grainy it’s like drinking wet sand. you’d think it was a lesson learned, but i decided to give the chocolate flavor a shot. this time i blended it with ice because certainly that would hide the texture. nope. same gritty texture, just colder. wish i’d gotten to try this before the reformulation so i could see what the old reviews were raving about. for now, i think i’ll run (not wall) back to my isopure."

"too much alcohol (11%) with a bad taste!. the alcohol overpowers most of the taste that it has. the after taste is horrid once you get past the alcohol-chemical taste. it does have a sweetness to it, but it's too weak. going unused in my cabinet...maybe i can make a cocktail out of it somehow."

"do not buy. these ""long length"" pads are not long at all.  they are short, a normal length, and not wide enough.  very disapointing!!!  really, i could design a better pad without trying."
smell like fish!. probably have good things in them but i couldn't stomach them! the smell even stuck to my hands!

"very strange seller!. be careful with this vendor, they will automatically without any permission nor request from the client!!!!! very weird!will stop payments and file a complain!"
dry wipes. does not get the job done.. these wipes are basically mildly moist cotton sheets. it does not compare to the other 99% water wipes. you have to use triple the amount of sheets to clean up a messy diaper (when compared to seventh gen). very disappointed with these wipes and even more disappointed that i’m stuck with them since you can’t return them if you opened one of the packs.
check expiration date. good but expired two months ago when i received it
when someone buys you should sent it to the buyer.. i order it and never got it delivered
don’t buy if sensitive to smell!. the smell is so bad!
didn’t like the taste. taste was off
"pills are too large. my only complaint about it is that its pill is too large, and very easy for me to get choked."
"obviously tampered with. i have used this product in the past and it is great. it tastes good, and gives you a pre-workout or late afternoon boost without the jitters and face-flush feeling that other nitric oxides can give you. but find another place to purchase. this product was shipped in a plain padded envelope, which is obviously insufficient. the quality seal on the lid was broken, the quality seal underneath the lid was not sealed fully, and the powder was spilled all over the inside of the envelope. i mixed some up (but obviously didn’t drink it). it seems... different than the product i have purchased in the past. i suspect it may be counterfeit or tampered with. for a supplement that you’re intended to ingest, this is obviously very dangerous."
they dont work as well as metimucil. as compared to metimucil powder they do not work as well. i am not as regular. i know my body and they are not as good. i was taking 5-6 pills a day and nothing. i would have give 2 stars but i dont know if i was taking enough. 3 stars is fair in my opinion. wont be reordering.
not yummy.. dislike. bad taste. will not order again.

terrible packaging.. packaging was terrible. i was going to give this as a gift and it was completely broken in.
too salty. soooo salty!! must be a bad batch because they weren't before.
bottled  damaged.  contacted customer service. will wait for response.. bottled damaged.
did not recieve. never arrived
"not sure it does anything for me. maybe my box was defective some how, but i got no instructions on usage. i used the all powerful (and never wrong) internet to come up with my own set of instructions: under the tongue, let it sit, one dropper full at night.i didn't notice any changes after a week of use. so i started using it just whenever i felt  stressed & really no effect there either. i'm glad it is working for others. i wish they'd left the thc in.it does have an odd taste. i don't get mint at all. it's more of a cantaloupe flavor...don't know whether to try other oils or just throw in the towel and accept the stress."

"not once, not twice, but three times. i have never left a review on a product. i imagined when i did, the product would be mind blowing, but i never thought my mind would be blown by receiving the wrong item on three separate occasion, all within the same week.i just do not understand how you can mix up ""chocolate"" with ""vanilla bean."" do they start with the same letter? no. do they have the same amount of letters? no. are they both one word? no. look i understand mistakes happen, but there is no way this is a mistake, not when the spacing is so close.i wish i could give this product an honest review, but it is not what i ordered. the vanilla bean i would give two stars because it taste better than what i thought it would, however i do not like vanilla bean and i will have to give it away or trash it.customer service, i will give five stars because i had opened it without looking to make sure it's chocolate and they still helped and sent a replacement. the second and third time i made sure to look and it was still vanilla bean."

expect the box to rip open every time. the biggest reason i was forced to stop using these is the box. several times the boxes have split open and spilled dozens of bags all over the floor...do you know how annoying it is to pick up bags like these and then attempt to stack them up neatly and get them back into said box? it became so frustrating that i decided to just purchase a different brand. also as others have stated the bags themselves are thin and can rip easily.
"underwhelming & inconvenient. i didn’t notice much effect while taking  this proaduct, & there was no noticeable difference when i stopped taking it, which is usually how i can tell whether or not a such supplement is working. my biggest issue with this product is how much of i you have to take. the suggested use is 2 tablets 2-3 times a day, & it has to be taken with food. for me, it is not worth the hassle of taking it with every meal."
"waste of money and very messy - not what i expected. firstly this is made in china. i cannot take off a star for that since it is written on the bag (though tiny and blurry in their product photo). i assumed non-gmo and organic meant it was not from china, but that is not the case. my error on that one.i will give it a low rating due to it having virtually zero sweetness unlike two other erythritols i have tried. it does not taste bad (i actually tried the powder straight on my tongue to see if it had any flavor at all) and it had a very slight sweetness when eaten pure). i put two heaping teaspoons in coffee and barely noticed it so i almost question whether this is pure erythritol, though perhaps it is, but a different type (i am not an expert on what makes some sweeter than others - except for the monk fruit that some of them have).as far as the ""messy"" comment... there was powder all over the outside of the box, though the bag was not torn and there was no loose powder in the box so it must have come from the factory that way. the top of the bag is difficult to tear off to access the seal. in trying to tear the top off, powder puffed out. i then pinched the top very carefully and continued and it happened again (twice). i ended up with it all over my black shirt. hopefully i do not get pulled over on my way home from work! (yeah, it looks like i was on an all night coke binge). next time, i think i will stick to a granular one and go back to a brand that i have used before.in case you are wondering why i switched brands and why i got powdered sugar, i wanted something that will dissolve better in cold and i found that one of the other brands i previously used (so nourished) gave me a slight headache and contains silicon dioxide."

"fake product??? possible scam. this product did not come with an inner seal. the taste is very bitter and artificial. i'm wondering if they used the container and filled it with something cheaper and then resealed the outside. seems like several other reviews say the same across the different flavors. it's sad because on has such great, dependable products."
"no noticeable difference, coated with too much sugar. i can't really say i noticed any difference in my ability to focus, concentrate, remember, etc. and i'm not even sure if it's supposed to be cumulative effect, or if you're supposed to take it on an ""as needed"" basis.  also, i don't understand why they're coated with so much sugar.  to me, it seems unnecessary to make them taste like candy when the purpose of eating them is to increase your brain power.  honestly, i found a couple of times i felt like i experienced a sugar crash from them (and no, i'm not diabetic.)"

ugh. gave me headaches
"stink like fish. i bought this product based on my doctor's recommendation to get more vitamin d during my pregnancy. i ordered these because they are the same name brand as the daily prenatal vitamin i am currently taking. upon opening the package, they smell so bad! i don't understand why they have any smell at all because another vitamin d supplement that i had at home of a different brand (same ingredients) does not have any odor at all. these smell like they are fish oil tablets. i wonder if these were stored properly or not. needless to say, i do not feel safe taking these and will be returning for a refund. very disappointed. also - just to note, the bottle is huge and is about 1/3 full although all 300 are in there. seems very wasteful to use such a large container."

couldnt get past the taste. i wish i read these reviews before buying.  these taste awful.  they're the most bitter mediciney gummy i've ever had.
not for me. i wanted so bad to like these. i switched to these from a whole food vitamin and i sure feel the difference. i started feeling super tired and worn down once i got off of my other vitamins and started taking these.
just caused me more problems. my niece recommended this product as she had her gall bladder removed. i have symptoms similar to ibs so i decided to give it a try.  this product may work for some but it just made my problem worse.  i was hopeful as the prescription meds i take are very costly.
meh. it gave me energy but not for a whole day. and most certainly do not try to take more than one cause you will get a bad headache! (learned that the hard way)

package arrived unsealed and empty. this  negative review is not for the product for the shipping.  the packaging arrived  unsealed and empty.
tunnel vision and i felt like my head was in a vice. after 1 hour of taking this i had the worst tunnel vision and headache for about six hours.  i couldn't even drive.  this is not be on the market!
"good taste. but the expiration date expired way too soon. only one month after receiving them they were due to expire in a month. that would be a huge issue if you ordered multiple boxes. so yeah, improve on the expiration dates."

"not impressed. i had high hopes for this recovery drink. first, it did not come with a scoop, so i have no idea how much to mix. secondly, the taste is terrible. just plain gross."
"old. these vitamins didn't look right when i bought them, but i decided to take them anyways. my daughter refused to take hers. but i think i got a bad batch because the made me sick. also, my bones started aching. once i stopped taking, i felt better. i am taking some i bought from the local drug store here.....much better."

these taste like vodka + medicine.. really don’t like the taste.
"very hard to swallor. i take several pills a day including several supplement. of all the ones, this is the most difficult to swallow. it is a large tablet and has no coating. it sticks in my throat even if i break the tablet in half."

not palatable. terrible taste. couldn’t choke it down!!
product arrived 6 months after its expiration date. product was 6 months past it's expiration date.  no fault of the product or it's manufacturer.  totally on the seller.
"prefer playtex over these.  only work for light periods.. these are ok tampons if you have very light periods.  if, however, you have heavier periods, these don't work very well.  i definitely prefer playtex brand over these."
"no thanks. couldn't finish the box, made me very constipated."
"doesn't work. compared to on creatine it feels like im not getting anything out of it, no pumps, low energy, nothing. switched back to optimimum nutrition and day one the pump was back and energy levels were higher."
not what i expected. they arrived stuck together and hard
be careful....no iron in these gummies. i became severely iron deficient after switching from prenatal vitamins to these gummies causing me to have to receive iron injections before delivery. these contain no iron. only use if you are taking a separate iron pill.
late delivery in one week. the delivery delayed a week longer than expected.
"side effects .. it probably worked but severe side effects . severe headache, vomiting , nausea , stomach pain etc . throwing away ."
food poisoning in a pill! (for me anyways). i took one with breakfast at 6am and by 10 i was unable to leave the bathroom. i had almost food poisoning like symptoms. i was pooping about every 30 minute with terrible stomach pains and cold sweats. pretty terrible experience.

disgusting!!!!. these have the worst fish taste i’ve ever dealt with in a supplement. i’ve taken fish oil before and never have i tasted something so foul in my life.

mediocre. great value but the taste is just mediocre. i was excited to try a blueberry muffin protein but it wasn’t exactly what i was hoping for. it tastes pretty bland and has a chaulky texture but if you’re looking for cheap protein with carbs it does the job
"completely disappointed. i've read that this company was sold out to johnson and johnson and also read it was sold to nestles.  maybe johnson and johnson and nestles is the same company.  i don't need clarification.  i just knew the moment i read it had been sold out to one of those companies that i was done with this brand product.  i won't knowingly support any product or company that harms the earth and it's inhabitants.  we have to give our bodies the best nutrition we can.  it is even more important now than ever because of chemtrail spraying that contains aluminum, barium, strontium, etc., and poisoning our bodies, our air, water, and food, and sterilizing our soil.  vitamin c is so necessary to keep our immune systems as strong as possible."

"no iron. no iron, which is one of the major deficiencies of all humans and especially pregnant women. bummed because my pregnant wife took these for a month not knowing they didn't have iron."
"unsealed product. the item didn’t come in the original box. it looked like it was used, came in a zip lock and unsealed..."
extremely difficult to open bottle .... i haven't been using this long enough to speak of the product so i will do a new review later ~ i am writing because it is difficult foe someone with severe arthritis in hands to access product ~ please replace this weird top so i don't have to keep it in an unmarked bottle ~ thanks.
makes me sick. i've tried a couple of times and these cause great digestive distress.  i have a cast iron stomach so i am very surprised.  i am generally not allergic to anything.
"came broken. this product arrived in the mail shattered. vitamins all came out of the broken bottle and are mixed with glass shards in the box...""x brand"" says uneligble for a refund!"
"poor packaging compromised my entire pantry order. until ""x brand"" can figure out how to properly seal and ship pantry orders, i won’t bother using this service. why they didn’t think to place the cornstarch in a bag, as they did with the flour i ordered, i can’t imagine; but my entire order was caked with white powder, and one of the bags of snacks i’d ordered was open, adding to the mess. meanwhile, most of my regular ""x brand"" orders arrive padded to the max with seemingly superfluous packing materials. get your act together, ""x brand"" prime pantry."
sugarfree tastes better. accidentally ordered the one made with sugar. awful taste compared to the sugarfree one. cant wait to finally be done with this jar
"i never received my order!. i never received it! i want my money back now! and i can't seem to get you, ""x brand"", to do anything about this! refund my money!"
half empty bottle received. when i received this product it had leaked and a considerable amount of product had been lost.
"didn't work for me. caused bad stomach pain for the first day, after that made me regular; however, not super effective as far as weight-loss goes"

questionable flavor. flavor is off compared to prior purchases.
"allergic reaction. i just had a major allergic reaction to this vitamin. today was the 3rd day i was taking them and about 1-2 hours after taking, i had a full body rash, including my face. it could just be my body’s reaction. i am not quite sure what could be causing the allergy in the vitamin but figured i would share."
"these kept me awake all night. i was hoping these would have a calming effect on me and that i'd sleep soundly, but they didn't even make me drowsy. i actually felt the opposite, i was awake for hours and then off and on the rest of the night. they tasted okay, were a little too hard to chew in my opinion, and didn't do what they were supposed to do. i have better results with a cup of chamomile tea or a glass of wine. they do have a decent ingredient list, but that means nothing to me if they don't work."
poor tasting. large and bad tasting. i wouldn't recommend the supplement.

"shipped melted chocolate. chocolate was very melted on both containers inside the shipping package, we are expected to pay for return shipping on a bad product we were sent. not worth the $15-$20 to return ship the items :-("
no scooper to measure. gave me a headache
"package arrived open.  very difficult to get a refund.. product arrived opened, no safety seal.  returned items. took three emails and logging a case, still waiting for my refund."
"not effective at all. i try different probiotics regularly to get the benefit of different strains of bacteria and this was the only brand that did nothing. the pills i received were worn down and looked old but the bottle did not have an expired date. there was even powder from pulverized pills at the bottom of the bottle. i should have returned them but the reviews raved, so i decided to try them anyway. i have taken the whole bottle and was bloated the entire time and most days i took 2 to 3 pills to try to help with bloating and gas. don’t waste your money because there are many other brands that actually work well."

tastes terrible. ugh the taste is horrible..
"its tastes terrible. i love the regular double chocolate chunk flavor of the normal gold standard whey protein. this stuff tastes nothing like it. the hydrolyzed protein tastes metallic and you cant even mask it with anything. ive tried it in smoothies, oatmeal, and with milk and all of it tastes bad. would not recommend for an extra 6g of protein. just get regular protein and eat a heaping scoop each time."

useless. not effective
"odd taste, not cinnamon. definitely has an artificial like taste with a strong aftertaste similar to sucralose. regular stevia powder has much less of an aftertaste. it barely has any cinnamon flavor which is a bummer because i wanted to add an extra kick of cinnamon to my chai tea lattes i make at home. i will have to mix this with honey or regular stevia because the weird chemical flavor is too strong to use this alone and make it sweet enough at the same time. it almost has the scent of artificial chocolate flavoring and tastes more similar to that than cinnamon vanilla. it mixes well in my milk steamer/frother, but so does regular stevia. i think i'll stick with buying regular stevia from now on, but this works well enough for me to use it for a while."

not the best tasting gummies but works. i wasn’t impressed with the taste but the product works. i bought these because i had to stay with my mom while she completed her chemotherapy and i didn’t want to get sick and get her sick.  i used these gummies from january to march in tn while it was cold.
no difference. i didn’t feel any different by purchasing this product.
"stick to metamucil. bought this hoping for a cheaper alternative to metamucil. then i just wanted to finish the bag before i switched back to metamucil. now i dont think ill finish the bag. its grainy, doesnt mix well and is hard to drink and gels too fast. turns to applesauce while you try to chug it."
"hoped for more energy. i am almost finished with the first bottle. so far i have no improvements at all. i was hoping it would give me more energy, but nothing at this point. it doesn't bother my stomach tho., so that is good."
"very weak bags, split easily not good. these are just horrible garbage bags. they split very easily and can hardly carry a full load. trash bag rankings: home depot, target, then these are way way behind. not worth the savings or convenience."
"disappointing!. for more than 5 years i've been buying this, due to it's excellent quality, natural flavoring and nice taste. apparently, the manufacturer decided to revamp the flavor, and it tastes so bad. it is the perfect example of how to convert a great product into a complete disaster. the new version is naturally and artificially flavored, tasting horribly so i ended up discarding it."

tastes very fishy. tastes very fishy
many crepes broken due to poor packaging. fedex beat up the box and contents were damaged. these crepes are fragile and require better packing in the shipping box to withstand shipping abuse.
not recommended. didn't work for me
"taste like plastic, disgusting. taste like plastic and preservatives . i assume they’ve absorbed something from the plastic bottle they been sitting in..."
"stomach issue. i do not have a sensitive stomach but unfortunately this product gave me bloating, gas, and diarrhea. i used it as a meal replacement for breakfast and lunch. by the time it was dinner my stomach was in a lot of discomfort making me feel terrible."
"gag me!. these gummies taste horrible!  takes quite a bit of chewing to get them down.  i have to take a strawberry b-12 gummy at the same time to even try to overcome the taste of these!  and i ordered two bottles of these.....don't know if i will get through them all because i just can't abide the taste.  i haven't been taking them long enough to determine whether they are doing anything for me, but i chose these because they have collagen."
"bad texture. i was very excited to order these, they look just like the spring valley prenatals which i love. i love gummy vitamins because they are like candy! these, however, are not. the texture is so bad, it’s like mushy sugar in your mouth. it coated my teeth and made them hurt! being pregnant, you really want something that tastes good.... to me these did not."

product never arrived:  took 2 days and a couple hours to get a refund issued!. product never arrived.  marked as delivered but no one in my neighborhood has it.was home during the time the package was said to have been delivered...  so i know its a lie!
"hot flashes yes, everything else, not so much.. so, i had super high hopes because it stopped my hot flashes immediately, and about a week after starting it, i finally got my period, after 2 months of it being missing. i'm only 40 but it seems i am not ovulating every month anymore. i read another review where someone in a similiar situation said it started her periods again, so that's the main reason i bought this. i feel like every product of this type that contains black cohash does a great job of stopping hot flashes but that's about all it does. kind of the same thing with this product. i'm on my 3rd month of it and still not getting my period, after the one initial time, i'm pretty sure it was a fluke not related to the pills. meaning the pills did not start my period. anyway, for the hot/cold flashes yes it works. everything else, there might just not be a magic pill for those things unfortunately."
do not waste your money or time. completely ineffective for female health.
never received.. can’t tell you anything about it because all i received in the mail today was an empty package.

"not as advertised...in a plastic bottle, not glass.. i have ordered now mct oil in a glass jar for years. this was shown as a glass bottle but arrived in a plastic bottle. i have read where things leach into the oil via a plastic bottle so i do not use plastic. i have mad 3 calls to this company woohoo  with no return call. i tried to do a review on ""their"" sight and it blocks me. i have 30 days to return this plastic bottle and cannot get a pre-paid return label since they will not return my call. do not order from this company!!!!!!!!"
purity. why is the double rich chocolate less pure than the vanilla flavored? gold standard means across the board. right?
"odd smell. i wanted to like these, but they have a funky smell when you open them. i was initially concerned they were spoiled. sadly i would not buy them again"

"check them!. i received these and without really checking them out i put them in the closet until today. when i opened the bottle i noticed many of the vitamins were stuck together and turning white. i stores them in a dry, room temperature cabinet so i can only assume they arrived like this. i tossed the bottle to be safe but wish i had looked at them initially- would have returned."
open package. can’t use because bottle was opened before i received it.
bottle came opened. my vitamin bottle came opened. looked like someone has been testing these vitamins before delivery
poor pill quality. not sure what the issue is but vitamins split open when placed in pill container?  sure it was related to the drying process.
buyer beware. my previous review was not allowed to be posted.possibly because i told the truth. the box arrived tampered with and opened. the seal to the rose oil was broken. i am now not allowed to include photos in my review for proof.  i was refunded the full purchase price but buyers should beware
"delivery requires signature. this review is for the delivery, not the product.  i love the product.  delivery requires a signature and i work, so the product is not sitting at a facility a half hour drive from my home awaiting my pickup.  i would have just run to walgreens five minutes from my house had i known this would happen.  needless to say, i’m not making the drive for a $9 product and i guess i’m just out the money.  frustrating."
sticking with name brand. mine were stale and hard to chew even though the seal was not tampered with. a waste of money.

"gummy & fishy?. product is ok - you can taste the fishy-ness under the fruity flavor. reminded me of the affordable kind of fish oil supplements with the after taste. not sure of the product’s effectiveness, but will personally switch to something else w/o the fishy after taste."

no to order that size again. i was not satisfied with the size i received..
"good as a sunscreen, but a little greasy as a moisturizer under makeup. i burn very easily so i always use sunscreen.  as a sunscreen this solimo spf 15 brand is good for my early morning commute to work when the sun isn’t very intense, but i do find it a little greasy as a moisturizer.  if i put makeup on over it, the moisturizer makes my face very shiny and oily looking.  my skin is oily to begin with so this moisturizer makes it worse.  so not the best product for my particular skin type."
"no seal under the lid. i was surprised to open the lid and not see any seal under the lid that covers the opening. it's a little sketchy bc i feel like it would have been really easy to add fillers or other things into it, but the flavor is good."

"caused severe gi upset & diarrhea. i initially was hopeful that taking this calcium supplement would be helpful in treating my osteoporosis. however, after taking it for awhile i had to discontinue use of it due to severe stomach upset and daily diarrhea. i decided to see if not taking the tablets would help with the gi issues. after a week of stopping the tablets completely, my stomach is finally returning to normal. i’m really bummed that i had to stop taking it, as i’m trying to avoid taking prescription meds."
"terrible smell. i have taken this brand of vitamin d for quite a while but this is my first time purchasing from ""x brand"".  i opened the bottle & it smells terrible, so terrible i can’t stand to open the bottle.  what is wrong with this product"

"they send expired product :(. i ordered and got this product in the first week of june 2019. sadly, the bottles were all marked “best by 05/2019”."
wouldn’t recommend. wasn’t a fan of this product from the company.  i also felt like this did nothing and had other additives in this.
do not buy these!. this bottle arrived tampered with. look at how the styrofoam seal has been replace with shrink wrap and a heat gun. this is scary! do not buy from this source.  i buy these vitamins all the time and it has never been like this when i get it from the store.
didn’t get melatonin. i was supposed to get strawberry flavored melatonin but received raspberry flavored woman’s multivitamin. i’m disappointed i always get these and have never had an issue before. i will never by from this seller again.
not the best flavor. got this honey and i don't think it has a very good flavor. i would recommend something else.
two stars. taste is awful! please gelcap!!
"one star. folate is cheaper folic acid, which many people, including me cannot properly process. very disappointing."
"good product/ however watch ""x brand""'s automatic ticked boxes.. the products is very good, it works for me. however i did not realize the ""prime"" box was ticked and it appears that i've been paying for this service for months. when i realized it i thought i stopped it last month. i do not like the way ""x brand"" does as it pleases on my account. i'd also like to know what account you refunded my products on, in jan. and feb.  it's not the one that i use on ""x brand"", perhaps it's my old account that i have no access to!"
beware of wrapper. the major issue i had with these were the wrappers. i put them in my pocket and some within a few hours it was either half opened or all the way out of the wrapper. or when trying to put the applicator back in the wrapper it would fall apart. so the ramon itself wasn’t bad but i ended up throwing some in the trash because they came out the wrappers while in my pocket or bag.
"horrible stomach cramps, gas, diarrhea.... jeeze, that was horrible! i only took one pill last night with dinner and woke up with severe diarrhea, stomach cramps and gas. you don't even wanna leave the house. here is a little info about magnesium oxide: commonly used therapeutically as a laxative and relief for acid reflux. this type of magnesium shows high levels of concentration, but poor levels of bioavailability (only 4%)."
mary in kansas. did not work for me. sorry
false advertising only get 1 not 3bottles. do not buy this product states that it is a 3 pack they resent this item twice and i never got the 3 pack but i did finally get the 3 bottles that i paid for.
"fake. i was sold a second fake amino energy no seal except the outside black seal and it was a mess.i have had this on subscribe and essentially ""x brand"" has stolen from me by selling me counterfeit items."
did not get what i ordered. i ordered kids multi vitamins and receives calcium 500mg instead.i don’t need calcium....i really need the vitamins for my children!
"gives you horrible breath. whenever i took these, they'd leave a really bad, metallic taste in my mouth that last all day. i had to stop taking them because the issue was so persistant"

"seller is great, the product not so much. didn't really work for me, but the shipping was fast and product arrived in great condition."
"does not taste good - no flavor. this barely had any flavor at all, it was one of the worst protein supplements i have had."
was expiring soon. the three bottles were expiring in may of 2019.  i made the purchase in april of 2019.  was i supposed to use up three bottles of old product within the month.  sent it back.  got refund.
"good value but.... i didn't realize these weren't coated. for this price that's not a bad thing but i just can't stand the ""vitamin"" aftertaste. ."

"uses synthetic b vitamin :(. i find that this type of iron works best for me on a daily basis; however, the synthetic b vitamin cyanocobalamin can cause damage to one's vision. thus, i am switching to gentle iron, 25 mg, 180 vegetable capsulesby solgar, which has just the good iron needed without the harmful synthetics. i take a separate natural form of vitamin c and b-12 already (methylcobalamin)."
"did not receive correct quantity as advertized.. i only received 1 bottle of 100 count. should have received 100 count (pack of 2). i do not know who to contact to get this issue resolved other than by providing this review. this item is identified as not refundable, so if your shipment is incorrect, it can not be returned."
"chocolate flavor is horrible just stick with natural vanilla. i'm upset with the way ""x brand"" presents the product on their website.  i've been purchasing this product for years from ""x brand"" without issue.  but now it's very difficult to actually to pick the flavor you want.  there is no description in the product title of the flavor.  the flavors to choose from are cut off so all you see is natural, or natural, or natural.  i accidentally picked chocolate.  i tried to drink it.  its horrible.  what a waste of money."

"smell is a deterrent and taste like it was created in a science lab.. i wish there was a sweetener that doesn't have an after taste.  i am doing the keto diet so i can't eat sugar, otherwise, i would eat cane sugar.  i made what would have been some really good cookies but when i went to eat the cookie it had an odd bite to it which i figured was from the sweetener since it had a bad smell when i opened the bag.  i give up, stevia leaves an aftertaste and sends you to the bathroom and this has a really off taste and smell."

"price. this product is way over priced, seen the exact thing at wal-mart for $7 if you can get to the store."
very sweet. ok  very sweet… would prefer a much less sweet taste.  not sure doing that much for hair and nails… been taking for a month...
"terrible side effects. after taking it for 5 successive days i've very terrible negative feedbacki've got acne on forehead, thighs and even on chest wall"
"no lid. this did not come with a lid. it came in an envelope with just the foil seal. i had to find another container to put it in. although it seemed to still be air tight, no lid is somewhat off putting. i would expect the full item, including the lid, for $22."
doesn’t work for me. does not work for me!
awful taste to us.. i am returning these. absolutely the worst tasting ever.
"not for everyone. stucked up together i dont even know what i should do with it, taste is awful"
"not for everyone. stucked up together i dont even know what i should do with it, taste is awful"
very strong. i found 500mg to be too much for me. they upset my stomach and taking them too often made me feel sick. they are good if you only take one once or twice a week.
not delivered. did not receive product
they don’t really help. i’ve been taking these for two years and they really don’t help
"good value for the money, but did nothing for me. good value for the money, but did nothing for me. i expected to improve a lot of health issues for me, because i heard  good things about colostrum, but it did nothing for me. i took it every day and i'm half way through the whole bottle. either colostrum is not for me or it does not work at all, or it's just this product. will be hard to find out."
"natural. i love that this is a bigger bottle and come in a  2 month supply. there are no artificial colors, artificial flavor and  no chemical preservatives, this is important for our health benefits we are finding out.  it is made in a good manufacturing practices (gmp) facility which is beneficial too.  and what else could be a great brand other than being an ""x brand"" brand. price is not too bad for 2 months worth of vitamins. my son did not mind using these but i do not think he continued the whole two months."

(and yes i stored the pills in the fridge.) felt sick all day, hugging the bed.  had some toast around evening. always kind of trusted the brand. don't know if it sat in the warehouse too long. you can bet i'll be reporting this."

"check your product!!. liked the previous bottles (2) i used, however this one had discolored vitamins that i won’t consume for the safety of my baby. sadly i didn’t notice til over halfway done with the bottle.*pros: combo vitamin, tasty, soy and dairy free*cons: not as potent as other vitamins (less of the good stuff)"
good price if you aren't sensitive to taste. good price but horrible taste.
not bad bags. these are good bags and would have 5 stars but they are not good at staying in place.
shipping package. i just received the product yesterday but you definitely need to improve on your packing for shipments.  when i received my order the bottle was shattered and had glass all throughout the pills. i had to pour them out and get the glass out of them so i could put them in a sealed baggie. you need to put the bottle in something besides a big envelope for shipping.
"never received package but ""x brand"" compensated. due to my diagnosis of cancer, i must take this twice a day and ""x brand"" has the best price.  usually i have no problem with delivery but unfortunately i never received my order.  perhaps it was delivered to wrong home.  ""x brand"" customer service was wonderful.  they reordered the calcium vitamin d pills and expedited delivery.  thank you ""x brand""."
very sweet. these gummies are coated with some type of sugary substance so i can’t eat them. i didn’t realize when i ordered and some may enjoy the candied effect but for me it’s way to sweet so they are going in the trashx
"bad packaging. not sure if i am the only one received a broken package of this product. when it arrived, the bottle seal was open and capsules spilled out. it seems like the seal was burned. i hope this is not their regular product quality. i used to trust the quality of the garden of life! had to return it."

don't waist money on this one. chalky taste terrible
"must have gotten a bad batch. i am sending this one back, and mad i cannot send the myrrh back.  i kept all of the others i purchased and love them but these two yea no smell at all."
chemical taste.. horrible taste! it actually has a chemical taste/burn. save your money

"wrong item sent to me.. i wasn't sent what i selected and paid for. i was sent a higher dose which i don't need. is ""x brand"" no longer carrying the 3mg?"
before you buy this item please check the expiration date. the expiration date is jul 20 2019. omgwhich means only one month left.
"poor packaging. the reason for the 3 stars is the package was poorly insulated and many of the pills inside were broken in half. otherwise, the supplement itself works well."
defective product. this lot of product smelled horrible.  i contacted nature's bounty to report the problem.  they never responded.  that's fine.  i will never purchase any products from this company again.
decent. not as effective as other products i've used but works.
"poor delivery service. i placed an order of avocado oil( among others) to make homemade body creams for my god daughter who was recently diagnosed with stage 3 brain cancer. when i arrived home this is what my packaged looked like. so disheartening. it makes zero sense to return whats left of the product due to the cap was damaged and can not be consealed however i just wanted you guys to see how poorly the packaged looked once it arrived. poor delivery service. i wish i was able to leave a better review however once it reached me, the majority of it had spilled into the box."

"not the best mass gainer out there. tastes nasty and for the price it isn’t any better than any other mass gainer. lots of protien and creatine though, which is about the only good thing. i recommend gnc’s bulk 1340. it has tons of calories and tastes pretty good (in my opinion). also as soon as i switched to it i noticed a huge increase in my gains."

"made me sick. ok so, i gave it a 3 because i am certain there were other contributing factors that were happening at the same time that made my condition feel worse than it actually was. pms. also, i was a bit startled by the size of the pills but they were easy to swallow.i took these starting on april 2nd, and then by april 7th i suddenly got bad bouts of nausea, vomiting, and really, really bad fatigue. my pms hit me around this time too, and i only get back pain, constipation, tender breasts and some fatigue. i stopped taking them immediately. a little bit on the fatigue part - this was not normal for me. i was so tired i was able to sleep all day if allowed and i almost never nap and here i was napping everyday after work for the days of april 8-11. i had no energy to do anything. i now feel a lot better and am too afraid to eat these again, unfortunately."

"too expensive mistake to hit ""order again"". total rip off from this supplier... no idea how i ended up spending 24 cents a pill, when ai hit ""order again"" it's normally 2 bottles, this was 1 bottle of 90. usually pay about .16 cents per. never again from this vendor."
poison. read! this is toxic.

"awful taste!. taste awefull!! i have used now mct oil (non flavored) before and it was fine.  however, they missed the mark on this flavor! 🤢"

"horrible taste. i made the mistake of buying the large container because of the reputation of this product, and i ended up throwing the entire thing in the garbage.  the taste is awful.  i chose the strawberry flavor because i thought it would be good in smoothies, but it simply ruined the smoothie.  perhaps chocolate is better, but i will never know because i will never buy this product again."
"where is my order. i still have not received this last order, so i cannot rate it"
it's a gel cap alright. got more heartburn than anything else from this. bought it because my boxing coach suggested it. did not see much benefit. maybe you will? active ingredient is ginger.
"gnc calcium citrate 1000mg. what i didn't see anywhere on the product add was in order to get 1000 mg worth of calcium you need to take 4 250 mg pills. i purchased these for my mother, because her oncologist said she needs to take 1000 mg of calcium a day. with the amount of pills she has to take each day, she isn't happy having to take 4 additional pills. i am not at all happy that the product description didn't mention that each pill is only 250 mg. i feel like i wasted money on this product due to misleading labeling and product description."
do not buy-smells like mold/mildew. do not buy! this face wash smells horrible. it smells like mildew. i’m throwing it all away after 2 days as the smell is the worst.

"can't stomach the taste. i really wanted to like this protein powder, because it's free from added sugars and sweeteners and has been independently tested for protein content and safe ingredients, but the vanilla taste is pretty awful. can't stomach it without adding in frozen berries or honey or something sweet. if that doesn't bother you, then go for it."
"easy to swallow, tastes and smells....not so good. the biggest disappointment  is the smell. it's pretty strong. i'm also not thrilled having to take 2. i don't mind the taste as bad, but that's not so good either, but don't worry, the smell makes you forget it. they are easy to swallow and not huge like some other multivitamins i have tried....but then, you have to take 2. that kills the value."

"very disappointed!. i have been using this product for two years. i usually order from vitamin shoppe but, i decided to order ""x brand"" this time. big mistake. i am extremely disappointing! i have never experienced the fishy smell and taste as i am now. i am unable to complete this bottle. i will have to go back to vitamin shoppe and purchase it again. hopefully this was just a bad batch. will purchase from vitamin shoppe and hopefully it will be better. very disappointed garden of life!"

don’t order this.  get flakes!. this is the worst yeast i have  ever tried!  i could barely swallow it it taste so bad!  other brands i habpve used are excellent.i tried to return it but it was no returns so i lost my 20 bucks for two of them. i do not recommend this at all. pay a little bit more and get some that tastes good.

"naturally flavored simply watermelon is horrible!. naturally flavored simply watermelon has got to be the worst tasting drink mix powder i have ever tasted, bar none. it has the most disgusting flavor profile. do not order this, you will be disappointed! the regular watermelon flavorby optimum nutrition is much better, although that one contains artificial flavors and sucralose. while i commend optimum nutrition for trying to make a naturally flavored energy powdered drink, this one fails miserably. the simply watermelon one needs to be reformulated for sure."

"terrible service.. the kirkland marcona almonds were ordered on may 16 and arrived on may 30! the plastic jar was sent in a tiny box which crushed the jar, breaking the jar and the lid. almonds scattered everywhere inside the box. i waited 2 weeks for damaged and inedible order. very disappointing that ""x brand"" uses this vendor."

"if you like stevia, to for it.. i wanted to like this so bad, but i had a few sips and instantly gagged. maybe it was the stevia but i had to return it. i’ve had other protein powders with stevia but this was just too overpowering"
"not effective. it does not seem to do anything, unlike my dr's best digestive enzyme complex, despite having most of the same enzymes in it. ""x brand"" must not have great quality control on this and i will not be buying this product again."
don’t waste your money. didn’t do anything
hope they're working. i hope they are working. extremely difficult to swallow
i bought these for my first trimester because of my .... i bought these for my first trimester because of my morning sickness i could barley swallow a pill. however the acidic citrus flavors grossed me out and the texture is so mushy thy were really hard to take. i also noticed how high the vitamin a is in them and it is far too high for being pregnant and could cause birth defects. my doctor advised me to stop taking these immediatly.

"terrible delivery!. my computer says order delivered monday...it is now saturday. i kept looking for a delivery, then noticed a prime package envelope sticking out of one of my large planters that line the inside of my fence in front. i thought it was an empty envelope that had just blown over the fence & was shocked to find it was the order i'd been expecting for a week!i live on a corner lot; property is fenced, with 2 large 4' locked gates & two unlocked smaller entrance gates that are easily accessible. the one in front has 2-24"" w x 30"" h gates, held together with small chain looped on top in center. inside is covered with black plastic so pkgs. put inside are not visible from the street. the side wrought iron gate-next to the larger locked gate,  is also easily opened & i have a covered front porch with shade cloth, making the poarch not visible from the street.my fence has been up for over 25 yrs. i've never had problems with any delivery until this one. some of my neighbors have their deliveries sent here as packages are so easily concealed from the street-when they are delivered correctly. they just threw this one over the fence. luckily it was not damaged in all the recent rains & my plant & the vitamins are fine.the driver was, should be reprimanded & given better training. jcgroff"

didn't work for me. didn't work for me
"disgusting tasting!. a few of the flavors i liked, not many.  most are very unpleasant.  will not purchase again.  i lot of the flavors i found to be disgusting."
i ended up haves bad head aches and ended up in th er two time. this item ended up putting me in the er
"made me incredibly sick. i took just one capsule, since i didn't know how they would affect me (i'd never taken acv before, but i'd read about all the benefits, and i read the ""x brand"" reviews). about an hour later, i became so nauseated that i started burping up and nearly threw up. i do plan to try again, as i'm not sure if it was simply the acv interacting with what i had eaten previously, but i'm nervous. if you've never taken acv, you may want to read about some of the adverse side effects it can cause. be safe and be sure. i'm certain  it's a quality product, as i currently take several supplement from the same manufacturer (now), and i've had only positive experiences."
"taste is horrible. i’m sure these worked great, but my 8 year old said they tasted disgusting. i stopped giving them to him after trying for myself."
"on should be embarrassed.. this is a very poor choice: only 22 grams of protein and loaded with junk. really expected more from a name like on. but is nothing like the 100% isolate i had been using. this does not mix well, tastes terrible and a very poor value. it reminds me of the cheap stuff offered at membership clubs for much less and better products."
"not great taste. ok, so i used to get the vega one powders and loved them. i decided to switch to this one bc it had less sugar. unfortunately, the taste it not that great. this has too much artificial sugar flavor. i was very disappointed. i’m going to have to find a way to try to mute the sugar flavor the next time i try to make a smoothie. please, vega, remove this sugar  flavor taste! make it more natural vanilla flavor not an artificial sugar taste. your products are great, just don’t ruin it with artificial flavors.ps: the pouch is a bitch to close. well, it doesn’t really close. i had to transfer the powder to a air tight container to keep it."
"eh. i really had high hopes for this protein powder. tastes just as gross as all the other ones i've tried. my husband tolerates it with chocolate almond milk. it is nice that it blends well without the use of a blender, i appreciate that."
tastes absolutely nasty. bought the cake donut flavor because it was the cheapest. big mistake. it has this nauseous artificial sweet flavor that leaves a chalky taste. just gross. i should have paid a few extra bucks for a better flavor.

"too thin.. you can make a mess and waste product.. when i mix to water, it was slightly thicker than other protein powder that i tried before. my body didn't get bloated and the taste isn’t that bad, it didn't bother me. what bothered me the most is the fact that this powder is sooo thin and if you are not careful you make a mess. let's see how long is gonna last the bottle and how is going to be the following weeks so i can decide if i will buy it again or not."

"here fishy, fishy.... i can’t get past the smell. they smell like fish. i was hoping they’d help my nails and hair grow. i can’t imagine trying to swallow these if i was pregnant. the smell alone would make me toss my cookies. pay extra and buy the gummies."

"switching brands. i bought this product in september 2018 but just started using it about 5-6 weeks ago. i had another brand to finish first. when i first opened the bottle there was a bit of a smell but what you expect with vitamin b. over the last couple of weeks the smell and taste have become intolerable. the smell is so rotten and so strong it just lingers even after i've longed close the bottle. i checked the expiration date, it's september 2020.  i toughed it out till yesterday but seriously this just can't be healthy. i will no longer be taking these b vitamins.  i do take a couple of other now brand supplements but i will be looking for a different brand for my b vitamins."
"not much bang for the buck. the blueberry flavor was ok. the bar itself was very chalky tasting. there are better, cheaper."
ok probiotics. these are ok but they started making me very nauseous. everyday i was feeling sick throughout the day to the point of almost vomiting. my doctor told me to quit taking
"packaging was too flimsy to contain the bags. these bags spilled right out of their box upon opening the larger ""x brand"" box. the packaging for these bags is simply too flimsy and now i have a bunch of loose bags. very inconvenient. i even put them back in their box but the weight of the bags caused them to slide right out of the bottom, the box simply would not stay together. this is the first ""x brand"" brand product i've ever been disappointed with. the bags themselves seem ok but not great. but the fact that i was unable to keep them in the box and draw one at a time is a deal breaker."
it helps. okay  its the fourth day i am taking this  it does help a little  for me it kicks in 2 hrs after taking it  i just not feeling the urge to eat sweets physiologically  but it doesn't last long enough  and also i feel a little bit nausea  after having a bite of chocolate but it doesn’t take away ur taste bud of sweetnessconsidering the price i guess its not bad well i wish it could kick in quickeri will keep update of further progress
"is not good for sleep. this product no works for me, is not good for sleep"
"drinking moist sand. worst protein shakes ever. both the premade or the powder feel gritty, like moist beach sand. so gross!"
"didn't do anything for me. i bought it to stave off urinary tract infections, but it didn't work for me."
"sold old bars with an expiration date of the end of this month!. i bought three boxes of these bars, they arrived on april 11th and have a use by date of may 2019 so they are essentially stale on arrival."

hate the taste of it. the taste is not too pleasant i used it once after that it’s just sitting in my cabinet

"holes in both bags!. really like the flavor, but the holes in the bags detracted from presentation and made a mess!"
"plastic container that it shipped in had already been opened. not only was the plastic container that it shipped in open, the actual nasal spray containers had no tamper resistant seals on them."
"unsatisfying transaction. the original order was not delivered to us,  and we asked for a replacement.  now we are told that because we did not return the original order to you, that we were to be charged for it as well.  we had nothing to return, because we never received anything except the second order you sent.  this is the worst experience i have had on ""x brand""."
"causes nausea and gas. gave these to husband with high hopes. like the ingredients and origins. like that they're directly from ""x brand""'s supply chain so was confident in the safety and security of them. but, after less than a week taking them he threw them out. they consistently gave him nausea, heartburn, and gas within a short amount of time after taking them. he has this problem with other multi-vitamins, too, but not with garden of life mykind organics vitamins, which have features comparable to these."
packaging is an issue!!. you know you are gyro have a problem when you smell your package before you see it!!! at least half of the essential oil leaked out before it even arrived! very poor packaging!!
"dissapointed. i've been using these for years. i always purchased them in person at the gnc store. i ordered them from ""x brand"" the last two times and this last bottle did not work at all. i dont know if it wasn't stored properly bc it wasn't expired i checked the date or if its just a fake conterfeit  but wont be purchasing  them ""x brand"" anymore!!!"

packing damaged. probably tampered.. the packing box was damaged. wasn't sealed at all. as you can see it's like someone glued it every lightly. opened with no efforts. like it was already opened before.
"good protein powder. taste is okay compared to other protein powder on the market. great price but not a fan of the ""natural flavors"""
"good value. price is right for these. no idea what they do- i noticed no difference with myself. however i’d imagine if they truly cleanse, it does me no harm to take after a holiday or a binge fest to right the ship again!"
"the lid was open when delivered.. i just got this oil today. the lid was open when delivered, and the oil was spilled in the box. it was even dripping from the box. a fan was delivered in the same box but looked ok. i was very disappointed. even though i haven’t tried it yet, i can tell it smells great."
"they were expired. the expiration date was for the month i received them! i won't order from them again, really only wanted the cinnamon flaovor but that was not an option"
"upset my stomach. i had the vanilla ice cream powder two times following a workout. first off, i really like the smell and i enjoyed the taste with about 7oz of unsweetened almond milk, it tasted like a light, sweet cream. but both times my stomach felt really upset about 45 minutes afterward, so much so that i felt like i was very close to throwing up. i'm not lactose intolerant or allergic to anything, i've never had stomach issues, and i've never felt bad drinking other protein shakes before.  so now i have about 20 servings of this stuff that i literally do not think i can stomach :/"

start off with a lower dosage. taste was a little off .... makes me feel  nauseated sometimes. i think i need a lower dosage tho!
someone took it.. never received.
not a good find for me. this did not work for me but alot of stuff has not.
it did not help me. it did not work for me but it may work for you
"expired!. i originally purchased this item at costco but have found that they no longer carried this item in stores.  when i first tried these, i loved them.  i went back to costco to buy more and soon realized that they must have been a seasonal item.... this  purchase was disappointing. there was no expiration date on the package but i’m almost certain they were expired. they were stale and very hard.  i don’t usually buy food products from ""x brand"", but i really wanted these pineapple rings.  i will not buy a discontinued item online anymore."

do not order in hot weather!. ordered flawless complexion and vibrant skin and loved the taste and thought i’d order again to give it a chance on helping my skin. the 1st order came in a cool wrap and i was impressed! today i got the 2nd order and they were in the cool wrap but they were not cool! gummies were melted and sweaty.. yuck! feeling disappointed.

"not impressed. i generally use tampax pearl or playtex products, but thought i'd try these. the applicator has some rough/sharpish edges at the insertion point, which indicates poor quality control and careless design. the tampon itself is really just rolled, which means it doesn't absorb very evenly. the price isn't very competitive either, especially if you wait for tampax pearl or playtex to go on coupon at costco. i'll stick with that."

amounts of epa and dha very low!. 200 softgels  spring valley fish oil 1200mg provides 750mg omega 3 fatty acids epa 360 mg dha 240 mgomega 3 by vitafusion.com120 gummies  100g of fatty acids epa/dha combined is 50mg total! therefor i would need to take at least 400 mg! of which i do not have any idea the amount of epa and dha
horrible toilet paper...... horrible.......falls apart horribly.....do not buy!
"the flavor of this one just isn't for me.. the price is okay, but the this is not at all my favorite flavor. it's the first time i've tried a drink mix in peach and i can't say i'd ever plan on ordering one again. i can't tell really if it helps with energy and ketosis at all because i can't really bring myself to drink this regularly. i recently tried another mix that was a berry flavor and i've been happy with the results of that one and it's much easier to drink. this ones just not for me."
"usually the almonds are fresh, but this time they were melted and old looking and tasting. a tasty snack. don't know what went wrong this time. the item had a lot of nuts melted together. the chocolate looked powdery and it tasted stale too. i am a repeat customer, but these almonds should not have been shipped. even the label did not look fresh."
okay for adults and no for kids. okay for adults. wouldnt recommend for kids especially to wipe their running nose. not soft enough and creates redness
good for the price. i ordered this because it had a good price. i have used many different protein powders and weight gainers over the years. this one is a good value for the money but i won’t be purchasing it again because of the taste. it’s far too sweet and has the lower end weight gainer pancake batter taste.
"soybean oil - no good. vitamin d3 is great, howeven using soybean oil is not good at all. thanks, ""nature made"" but most soy is gmo."
ok. no results for toenail fungus
"cut potassium down to 1/4, totally useless now. this was my go-to product for drinkable potassium at 400mg per serving. i used it every day for years, for heartbeat stabilization and energy. now, it's useless, and does the opposite of replenishing potassium. it makes a sodium imbalance worse, because there is double the sodium than potassium, and not enough potassium to bother. it's amounts larger than 1-200mg that need to be in water. for only 100mg, i can take a capsule. i cannot believe they ruined such a good product.  vega says they removed all these minerals ""based on previous consumer feedback, and changing sport nutrition research, with the goal of making this product effective and current."" lol. really? all you are getting from this product now is 50mg calcium (used to be 180), 20mg magnesium carbonate (used to be 100), 115mg potassium (used to be 400), 230mg salt (used to be 100), 60mg c. the only thing good about it is the c from acerola."
"do not get naturally flavored vanilla!!. i have had several different flavors of this brand and they were good. thought i would try a different flavor this time and the naturally flavored vanilla is terrible! it reminds me of warm baby formula, even if it's cold with ice in it. i would not recommend this flavor, however i would recommend the brand and other flavors. going to be checking with seller regarding a refund or exchange of some sort."
fruit fusion is gros. i love the amino energy drinks but the fruit fusion flavor is nasty!  tastes like robotusin.
doesn't help. doesn't help much
"my teenage daughter will not take them!. i bought the men’s and women’s version at the same time. of course the men’s was for my teenage son and the women’s was for my teenage daughter. my son absolutely loves his and doesn’t miss a day! his are multi flavored and have a sour taste with a sugary coating (which was what i thought i was getting when buying these as well). the little bit of sugar that comes on the men’s is not enough to hurt him and is worth it because he actually loves them. unfortunately this product did not come like the men’s vitamins that i bought at the same time (same brand, same everything). this product is not multi-flavored, it only has two different colors which are pink and purple. they do not have the sugar coating (which is what teens love), and my daughter says they are disgusting. she will not take them at all. perhaps it’s her age and not everyone will feel the same. i just wish the product would have been what i thought i was ordering. now i just have to throw this product away and i am out of the money i paid for this product. i am quite disappointed."

disgusting taste!. they may include many great things for your body but they taste disgusting! i wasn't able to eat more than 1 a day for a few days and eventually i just threw them away because the taste was so bad. i definitely do not recommend.

contains lead?1?!??!. i ordered this a while back and didn't use it. i took it out to use it today and noticed on the top of the lid it said it may contain lead??? how is this acceptable? i bought it for lactation cookies and there is no way that i will use it now. very dissapointed. wish i could return it but my return window is closed.
pill size. very disappointed. from the description i thought these were small pills. they are much larger than i expected. can be difficult to swallow
seal broken. unsealed so i’m not sure if it is the real product or not.
gross. taste and smells horrible apparently you have to pay $60+ for a decent shake
gross. taste and smells horrible apparently you have to pay $60+ for a decent shake
broken bottle. glass bottle arrived broken
did not work. product did not work for it’s intended purpose
sensitivity to ingredients. beware of certain ingredients for allergic reaction. my joints (knuckles) in my hands swelled and were painful. stopped taking product and swelling has gone down and pain subsided.
"eat before!!!. cannot stress enough the importance of eating before. i have a very sensitive stomach, and this makes me sick easily."
"absolutely disgusting cough syrup. yes. it tastes like cough syrup.  it was not tasty even if you put it in the water. this makes me not want to try the other flavora, but i heard the english toffee is good. again, disgusting and cannot even return it for being disgusting. who let this out of the testing?!"
"nature's bounty black cohosh 540 mg. used the whole bottle , unfortunately did nothing for me."
damaged product. the product arrived in a fused state and couldn’t be removed from container. possible heat damaged? note on shipping status no returns.
doesn't work!. i was taking 20 grams a day for a month than i had a blood test and it showed i had low creatine in my system even with all those grams i have been taken.
both jars completely busted.. both jars lids were completely busted off. absolutely no bubble wrap or cushioning of any kind inside the box. there are multiple reviews here about leaking or broken containers. costco needs to make a stronger lid and it needs to be shipped with cushioning.
details. the bag was not perfectly sealed so some powder got lost
"sunscreen, not a moisturizer. as someone with very very pale skin that burns easily, i always wear a facial cream with spf. i have been fooled by the product labels on multiple items though - i don't want just a sunscreen, i want a moisturizer that contains sunscreen. big difference! i was a little worried by the labeling on this item as well - is it a moisturizer or a sunscreen? well, this definitely falls in the sunscreen category. it has that sunscreen smell and consistency, and absorbs like sunscreen - so you're left with a shiny face if wearing it alone. i've found products like this are good to use over other moisturizers that don't contain any spf - for example, my favorite winter face cream is laneige water bank moisture cream, which does not have spf."

"horrible taste. this formula is so thick that it’s almost impossible to get down, especially twice a day!"
"allergic reaction. i had a severe allergic reaction to the pills. i don’t know what’s in it in order for my body to have all over burning, red rash. had to go to er and take steroids for 5 days."
not working for me. this product seems to be having the opposite effect and actually keeping me awake.
"digestion issues. much more convenient to take than powder. and it's creatine - it works.however, like one of the top reviews, i ran into digestion issues with this, where i hadn't before with other creatine powder, potentially due to fillers in the pills stomacheaches, pain, indigestion, runs, etc. drink lots of water with this and avoid if you've had issues with creatine in the past. shame - have never had an issue with optimum nutrition in the past"
"is it real?. i bought this olive oil because this brand was on a list of olive oils that were said to be genuine. i put some in my drizzle bottle and put it in the fridge for 24 hours and it did not solidify at all. it is my understanding that real olive oil (not dyed and flavored impostors) will solidify in the fridge and i have had others that will. i'm quite disappointed and will continue my search for good, real, reasonably priced olive oil."
not a fan. i was excited to try this. i did not care for the tart cherry taste though. i could barely get through one shake.
"wouldn’t buy them again. good until you get towards the bottom. they’re soaking wet that they drip. wouldn’t recommend, costco’s kirkland signature brand are way better"
"seems old and nothing like the ones you buy instore. the bottle i got seems to be old. they are not like the ones i bought instore last month at all. these are dry, rough feeling, and taste awful."
this is a counterfeit product.  please see the other reviews.. i made the mistake of continuing to use this even though it wasn't oily like the regular kirkland minoxidil.  it also foams up when you rub it in.  i have lost a lot of hair and finally started looking up the reviews and i'm seeing the same thing stated.  do not buy.

tastes nothing like pb or chocolate - flavor should be titled ‘natural’ nastiness. arrived on time but smells weird and doesn’t taste anything like peanut butter or chocolate. very disappointed since i usually love this brand...

do not order from this seller!. never delivered and never responded to email.
"just take $25.00 and throw it in the trash!. i was hopeful, and it sounded good.  however you might as well take $25.00 and throw it in the trash.  this stuff is disgusting and now that i’ve done the research on the ingredients i wish i would have never gotten this.  my daughter wretched and she loves everything even very herby healthy flavors.  this is a fail.  ten thumbs down."
"new box smells dangerous. i have to say that up until this box, i loved these gloves.  i use them for diapering, cat litter cleaning, using to break up food for my special needs child, etc.  for everything basically!  they have been my life savers in the winter to prevent drying and cracking.but i opened up this box, and there were horrible fumes coming out.  it smells like petrochemicals and dangerous.  i also experienced a lot of itchiness on my hands when i was using them because i had a stomach virus and didn't want to get anyone sick, but i am not using them now.  i need to contact the company and find out what is going on.  i would consider these unsafe until further notice."

"too sweet. not sure about ingredient quality.. i wish i read ""x brand"" reviews before purchasing it in a store... it tastes disgustingly sweet for smth that has less than 1gr sugar... i tried to add more water, tried to use various nut milk options. it does not feel healthy and i actually feel less energized than after trader joe's protein shake that costs half as much... it does not feel like a quality product."
"no difference at all. i've been taking this religiously for 16 days now. i noticed absolutely no difference. my parents are also saying the same after 16 days, that they haven't noticed any effects at all."
"bad smell and taste made me gag and gave me a stomachache all day. this product was completely different in taste, powder texture, smell and appearance from the last time i ordered this from the same supplier. as soon as i opened the canister, i knew something was different. it only took one sip before i was gagging and had to dump out what i mixed. it tasted so vile. since then, my stomach hurt all day. i'm pretty sure this batch was tainted."

got a used and opened product. pill bottle was really dirty on the outside when i received it. like it had sat on someone’s dirty counter and had food and stuff stuck to it. it was also already opened. unacceptable
allergic r xn. allergic reaction full body rash had to throw out. doc thinks it was the horsetail
"cookies and cream review. i typically love on products and have enjoyed several other flavors.  this one unfortunately will have to be mixed or trashed due to the poor quality of the taste.  i'm not sure if i got a bad batch as i've had it in the past, or if they have changed formulas but it is absolutely disgusting."

lost hair. losing hair from it
"the bars are great, but don't buy on ""x brand"". kirkland is costco's home brand, and they do not sell on ""x brand"". these bars are only sold by third parties who buy from costco, so they are going to be old and disgusting. just go to costco or order from costco online.i do highly recommend these bars from costco though"
did nothing for insomnia. it was like i just had regular gummies. this did nothing to help my insomnia or fall asleep faster.
"worse taste ever. this actually makes me vomit. i've used it for 2 weeks, switching between this and keto coffee for breakfast and i've lost so much weight it is awesome. but the taste is really terrible. i've tried it by itself and mixing it with other things but no matter what i do it sends me to the sink gagging. it's such a shame because it does work for weight loss."
"plastic packaging ruins it. it smells so strongly of chemicals.. this probiotic is great. of all the probiotics i’ve tried, it is by far the best one for me. i unfortunately had to stop using it because the container reeks of chemicals, and the capsules definitely absorb it. it’s such a shame that the packaging is so disgusting on a product i would love to keep using. i would much rather just refrigerate a glass bottle like every other brand of probiotic than have a special “shelf stable” bottle that smells like and makes everything inside of it taste like paint thinner."
fake. not good stinks is not the real deal had to throw it away along with the lemongrass oil i got from them
"severe stomach upset. i was really hoping these would help my husband who recently had gallbladder removal surgery. unfortunately, they had the opposite effect. instead of helping him digest foods and eliminate stomach upset after eating, they gave him severe diarrhea, nausea, and gas. he felt ten times worse after taking these. considering all the amazing reviews, i had such high hopes. perhaps he's just allergic to a particular ingredient, but these are a no go for him."
smell and taste horrible!. these smell and taste horrible! if you have a sensitive gag reflex do not purchase these!
"stay away!. these are huge, make me gassy and taste gross. i have a whole bottle i wont use now."

"burns eyes slightly if getting too close to eyes.  works well if i dilute it with a mild shampoo. i have been looking for something to replace the equate (walmart generic) dry scalp shampoo that i was using, that is no longer made.  (now they only make a 2 in 1 which i do not like).i thought this one would work, since it has most of the same ingredients.however, this one would burn my eyes, even if the shampoo was not getting into my eyes.  i never had this issue with the equate or even the head and shoulders.  it could be due to a higher amount of a harsh ingredient.  i dilute it with a more mild shampoo and then it works well for me.this shampoo also does not work as well as the equate did in keeping my head from itching."

"taste. i usually like this brand. i ordered a new flavor, peanut butter and  chocolate.awful....."
interesting formulation but hard to gauge efficacy. formulation is certainly interesting with this skin care supplement product (daily dose = 2x pills) as the primary active ingredient is something called 'lutemax 2020 (derived from marigolds) and vitamin a retinyl palmitate. pills are very easy to swallow as they are small (pinto bean sized) and smoothly coated. leaves behind no unpleasant odors or after taste and does not produce adverse reactions in myself at least. only problem is just over a month cycle its quite difficult to discern if this produced any noticeable positive effects.
"not impressed. somehow it tastes artificial to me. it has a coarse texture, so it's not pleasant to drink like the ones' i had in the stores."

"selling near to expiry product with mentioning the expiry date anywhere. the product expires in sep, 2019. unknowing the expiry date, i ordered two bottles. the seller should mention expiry date on the page when it comes to meds/vitamins/edibles. not appreciated at all."
caused significant issues with my vision. this made it difficult for me to see in the dark and significantly increased afterimages.
didn't relieve my pain. tried it but it didn't work for me
they are big pills. too big could not swallow them
tastes awful. neither my son nor i can stand the horrible taste. even mixed with oj the artificial sweetener comes through
tastes like pure sugar! no pecan flavor at all! do not buy!. i did not like these product at all. you can’t even taste the pecans. i wanted to return these immediately they were so bad. i do not recommend these at all! i will never order these again!

not tasty. coconut flavor doesn’t taste like coconut it has a pasty flavor. i just mix it with other things and hold my breath while i drink it. so whatever
not for everyone. i was hopeful to try this product after reading so many great reviews! however it didn't work for me. after 1 week of taking it daily i had to quit due to such bloating and weight gain. i have been the same weight for 10 yrs and in just one week of using this supplement i put on 5 lbs. not only did i gain weight but i felt brain fog and anxious. bummed it didn't work for me.

"didn’t enjoy. i really wanted to like this product, it has a lot of great ingredients and i wanted to incorporate these in my diet in a way that would be easy. the idea that it can be added to yogurts, etc. sounded really appealing. but it soaks up liquid like crazy, so when i added it to yogurt, it became almost a cement like paste, like mortar. very difficult to eat. so i tried just eating just a spoonful of it but it was impossible because it wouldn’t go down my throat because it was too thick, it just stuck to my teeth.  i had to just laugh at myself on that one, thinking that would actually work after the yogurt incident. putting it in just juice would be just a thick, gritty fiber drink, umm no thank you.  i just can’t figure this stuff out. i suppose you could bake it into something? i’m just not sure. i ended up throwing it away, it was just too difficult to figure out how i can actually eat this where it would palatable and i could actually get it down."
does not help. does not help with sleep or reduce muscle cramping.

not a fan of the taste/texture. i buy the gummy form of vitamins and fiber supplements because it's usually tasty and easier to eat (i often have to stop myself from eating more).  these are not tasty at all - your mouth will definitely think it's medicine.  the texture is also unpleasant and not chewy like gummy bears.  i regret this purchase and will stick to the nature's bounty one i bought last time.

"good but extremely difficult to swallow.. the daily supplements are great to take and hard to miss. they're somewhat larger than normal, and very condensed at that. they're easily the largest pill i have to take as a supplement that is not chewable."

"needs cherry, maybe?. the only food that has ever substantially helped with workout recovery was this stupid expensive cherry extract some company was putting out. then it disappeared. this product had no noticeable results. though i wanted it to work good! ""x brand"" makes great supplements--if you know the supplements work for you. if you don't know if they work for you, dont expect the ""x brand"" name alone to guarantee results. the name guarantees a good product at a good price but necessarily an effective one. i had no ill effects from taking this. so thats a plus!"

they were stale... i was not impressed at all.. not so wonderful...
you get a big melted blob. 80 degrees here and it arrived as a huge warm congealed blob of gummies. after cooling still just a big blob. it had a cooling pack in it that did not seem to help.
"broken seal/leaked everywhere. this is the 2nd time i purchase this product because i really love it; however, my bottle arrived today and about 1/4 of the bottle was spilled inside the box which also covered my other products that were packaged together with this. after removing the plastic “seal” on the cap, the foil cover was also opened. i’m now unsure if this product is safe to consume. i’m really disappointed with this purchase and will probably look for another seller for my future purchases."
"pills too big to swallow. i got these for my 10 year old son, but they are very large, and he could not / would not swallow them.  but my wife tried them, and she, too found them too large to take.they might be a great health supplement, but we'll never know because we can't gag them down."

allergic. this stuff made me break out in explainable rashes after taking it for a few days. i trashed it
"poor tasting monster knockoff. if monster ultrared and tonic water had an illegitimate child in the back restroom of a walmart, this would be it."
"be careful who ships it to you.. i got a shipment that i ordered last week.  the outer packaging contained debris and ants. one of the bags of flax seed meal appears to have been punctured.  the date on the bags was ""best by: 11/18"" in other words it's 7 months past expiration. ants are all over my kitchen counter.  my package came from ""fun stuff for sale"" from houston, tx. now i have to take a couple hours off work to repackage this sack of garbage and take it to a ups store and wait in line to ship it back to the seller before they will refund my money.  it'll cost me more in lost hourly wages than it cost to buy this crap."

"very expensive organic vegetarian multivitamins, contains sugar. this is a big bottle of vitamin gummies, but you need to take 3 of them to get your daily allowance, so the bottle is only good for 1 month. they contain sugar and taste more like candy than vitamins, if that is important to you. price is very high compared to non-vegetarian multivitamins, which will often give you a whole year's supply for the same price as this 1 month supply. if you require vegetarian gummy multivitamins, i do see other brands on ""x brand"" that are much cheaper, though i have never tried those so i cannot make a recommendation other than to shop around."

no good toilet paper. it is not good it is rough
not good for drinking. maybe good for cooking but is not good for drinks.
taste like shit. tasted like medicine.  i’ve tried lots of protein over the years and as far as taste goes this is the worst.  it has a metallic sweet taste like children’s medicine.  it’s like vanilla pesto bismol in a bad way.

overpriced for a mediocre product. weakened scent
my kids never received the item ‼️. they never received the item
flavor. that after taste and the watermelon is too strong
ripped open cornstarch everywhere. when i opened the package the cornstarch bag was open and cornstarch is everywhere but this item is not able to be returned or exchanged. very uphappy.
"not my fav c4 flavor. this one was mehhhh. the flavor tastes like it is trying to be carbonated but went flat. i also did not like the consistency of the powder, very chalky. love c4, esp c4 ripped, but im going to pass on this one next time"
no no. could not tell a difference
i will not buy again. i am not buying these again. if i knew i had to take three doses a day i wouldn't have bought them. i had found some at a store when i could have taken twice. i don't have time for that.
ok. little high on price
i miss the old vega. this tastes so gross!

"only because they are the cheapest you can get. so, i took these for a week and couldn't tell they helped anything digestively speaking.  so i took a bunch to see if they did anything at all or were basically placebos.  they actually do something, they are real probiotics, but they are very mild  and i would only take these combined with another better probiotic.  at the crazy low price they are i think it is worth while to take if you want an additional boost, but not alone, and maybe two or so.  other than that the downside is they start to dissolve instantly in your mouth which is really gross so i have to have liquid in my mouth already and then drop them in; which is not how i normally take pills, or probably anyone else."
"5-htp works great for me, but these orange chewables are really gross. these are so nasty. lol i was already taking cherry dissolvable b12 and thought this would be no big deal. nope. gross. i cringe every single time. and if you decide to taper your dose, don't do it by breaking these in half with a pill cutter...they just crumble. 😩 i'm switching back to capsules even though they're a little pricier."
"tastes awful. i bought this protein shake mix as a substitute for shakeology. i’ve used multiple different protein shake mixes in the past, and this one is by far the absolute worst tasting one i’ve ever tried. even using it to blend into a smoothie is downright unpalatable. i’m not a picky eater, i’ll eat most anything that’s put in front of me. i grew up on a farm and even when i opened this stuff, it smelled just like the formula we would feed baby bottle calves. absolutely do not recommend. (i had the vanilla)"
works well. this facial cleanser is gentle and cleans well. it also leaves skin feeling moisturized. i absolutely hate the smell. not sure why but i can’t stand it.
horrible stomach pain. don’t take this.  i bought this as my microbiome diet recommended this type of supplement.  not sure if its the brand or the supplement in general but i feel like i am dying.  i can’t function and have headaches all day with constant stomach and heart burn symptoms.  don’t take this.  after reading more negative reviews i now see i am not alone.
missing scoop. i have no issues with the protein powder. so disappointed to open the container and find no scoop.  how much do i need to scoop since there is no scoop to use? how much is in a scoop?
arrived with cap damanged!. if i open this i have to find a cap that will fit it because once the tinfoil seal is broken it could spill easily.
"quality control is lacking. i like these vitamins and have bought them for years. however, i'm noticing more and more that many of the vitamins are cracked, split, or totally broke in half upon opening the bottle.  i will only use the ones that are not damaged, so this last bottle i ended up discarding a quarter of the bottle because of this. at the price they are, i should not have to do that. i'm going to be seeking out a different supplier."
maybe. didn’t work for me but maybe someone else
product tampering. product was missing the tamper proof seal!!  didn't feel safe taking this product since it had been tampered with
"not good. first of all, it is 10% the sweetness of sugar.  in other words, it is not sweet.  it does have an after taste.  i read all of these glowing reviews saying it is just like sugar with no after taste.  not true."
"product is so so; only works when you put the very bad tasting powder directly on your tongue. i took this product every day for several weeks and noticed no difference in my sugar cravings. i suspect some of the reviews here are fake. some people here mentioned that this product makes sugar taste like dirt or bland. this only occurs when you take the powder out of the gel cap and put it directly on your tongue; this does not occur when you simply ingest the pill. to be honest, putting the powder on your tongue tastes pretty bad for about an hour  but if that's what you need to get through a sugar craving maybe it's worth it?"

"shockingly bad consistency/texture and taste. i was truly surprised by how bad these gummies are.  i take three supplements daily in gummy form and have used maybe four different brands at different times.  although i like some better than others, all were passable and i've never tossed a bottle uneaten before.  unfortunately, these ""x brand"" gummies have a terrible consistency and texture.  not exactly grainy, but something like it.  although some other brands i've tried are better than others, all have had just enough ""bite"" to them -- they are firm, but not hard to chew; they break down when chewed, but aren't sticky.  these stuck to my teeth and were just gross."

"the 3-pack does not come with 3, only 1..

size of softgel. i ordered the soft gels but the size is very huge and its difficult to swallow so gummies are easily administered.
"they did the opposite. i took these to help me sleep one night. we usually have good luck with naturemade, but i figured why not give these a try?i was up all night long! zero sleep. hopefully i got a bad batch and this isn't happening to everyone, but i'm going to stick with the naturemade for now."

"chemical flavor from turbo chocolate. i have been getting this protein for the last 6 years. i have had a good experience with it until this past week. something changed with their protein or they just have a severely bad batch that is going around. either way i hope it gets handled because the turbo chocolate is the worst protein i've ever had! i opened my brand new bottle and make myself a protein shake. to my surprise if tasted like chemicals. if you've ever been around a broken glowstick and have smelt it, that's what it tasted like. the taste was so bad i couldn't get it out of my mouth. i tried coffee, drinking a bunch of water, then finally i brushed my teeth, scraped my tongue and lastly chewed some gum. i could taste a little bit of the chemical taste so the gum helped to rid the rest of the awful taste. mind you i only took two gulps because there is no way i could get something like that down. i tried a different shaker bottle the following day to make sure it wasn't something in the shaker bottle and it was not. the protein was the problem. i had it returned and replaced. i received my replacement today and guess what...? it's the exact same. the same chemical taste that is difficult to get rid of. this one almost seemed stronger than the first. i could smell the chemicals as i brought it to my mouth.i have reached out the the company personally to let them know what was going on. i will update later on, but as of right now they just wanted me to complete a long list of information about the product first. i am normally not one to leave a awful review, but i think it would be best to forewarn others before they make the awful discovery and have to go through the returns and everything."

does not work for me. these pills do not work for me. my nails are more brittle and hair is dryer than usual.

""x brand"", pull it together. please contact me stat and give me what i ordered."
"not the greatest flavor. unless you absolutely need natural ingredients, but the flavor is not great. it taste like soap with a hint of apple. hard to describe the flavor but it  has a baking soda taste and it foams up like crazy when mixed. i'm going back to bcaa with artifical sweetener for now, this is just hard to drink. granted i don't usually do stevia not sure if this is commom with it. it also has a lot of sodium which is a negative for me. too bad i was really excited about this product."

"made me sick.. i took these vitamins 5 years ago when i was pregnant, loved them, now 5 years later i’m pregnant again and i began taking these and had terrible symptoms, stomach in knots, nausea, indigestion. i thought it was early symptoms of pregnancy and was really concerned something was wrong. i just figured out it was these vitamins making me sick, 2 days not taking them and my symptoms went away. i’m super upset. shame on you nestle"
not good pre workout. i didn’t feel anything after using it not like the other ones
"horrible fish smell!!. i’ve been taking this vitamin for about three years (through my first pregnancy, nursing my first, second pregnancy and into nursing my second). i saw a great deal at costco so i bought a bottle there instead of here where i normally order. got them home to find one had exploded thus making a bunch of others start to dissolve and smell. no big deal, exchanged for a new bottle. got those home to find they smelled horribly like fish!! figured maybe it was a costco things since none of my others from ""x brand"" had ever done that so yesterday i ordered another bottle. they came today, and guess what? there’s that disgusting fish smell again. it’s so bad i can’t even stomach taking them. they leave a taste in your mouth and a smell on your hands, even after several washings! i will not be buying these again."

genetics vary. dry hair to much can’t use. didn’t work at all 6 months for me
formula has changed - fake sweetness taste. i am returning this - the fake sweetness taste is disgusting.
"i received all three bottles and all inside were melted!!!!. i received all three bottles and all inside were melted!!!!actually i lost my money, i prefer to purchase it in winter"
terrible.. i like the powder version so i thought i would like this too and it would be easier for me. it’s disgusting. i hated it. i didn’t drink more than two of them. the powder flavors they have are much better. it’s worth mixing it on your own instead of buying this.
"this didn't work for me, but ymmv. i say this (ymmv) because melatonin in general doesn't work well for me.  however, i know people who swear by it as a sleep aid.  i hoped this one would work but everyone is different.if you are one of the lucky folks for whom melatonin works as a sleep aid, these are good!  they are gummy candies containing several herbal sleep aids.  they're blackberry flavored and the taste is good, definitely blackberry with a slight (but pleasant) herbal undertone.if, like me, you have trouble sleeping, they're worth a try.  i can only fault my own body chemistry, i guess."
not what i had expected. these are not chewable gummies like i thought! they’re like tums and the flavor and consistency are super weird.. if you’re okay with dissolving tablets then i would suggest these. you definitely can’t swallow these.

"do not buy from this seller! item received with seal broken. unable to return. when i received this item today the seal was broken and 10% of the oil has spilled out into the package.  it appears to have been adequately bubble-wrapped and shipped, which makes me more nervous that someone has tampered with this oil prior to shipping it to me.  i cannot with full confidence use this oil without knowing what has been done to it, and the seller doesn't allow refunds or returns, so this has been money down the drain.  do not buy from this seller."

not great. the lotion seems watered down. i would not buy again
"dissolved well, but caused nausea. made me pretty nauseated, so i gave up after two weeks of use. couldn't find anything i could eat/drink before or after to make it better. may not impact everyone the same. dissolved well and didn't have a taste, so that part was good!"
arrived damaged with no return option!. product arrived damaged and it had leaked when i opened the bubble wrap. and no return policy! really?????
negligible. no real difference
"too big. pill is very large and hard to swallow. i break them in half, but doubt i would buy again."

"turns food purple. i purchased this to make keto rolls.  rolls turned out a bit weird, but having made them twice now i know that is how they are.  kind of a mushroomy flavor, and they are purple, which is a side effect of psyllium husk use.  so the flavor and color are weird, and i would never serve them to non-family members, but that's how they are."

check the safety seals!!. received the product today in a timely manner... unfortunately i the clear safety seal was missing and when opening the cap the tamper proof seal was lifted up completely.very disappointed to see this get past quality check considering it's an ingested item. please check your bottle upon delivery.

never got product. i never recwived it and cannot get a refund.i ordered dec 2018.what is going on?

"watch the expiration date on food items from ""x brand"". i recently ordered 3 boxes and just noticed that all three have 6/2019 expirations dates :(  i didn't send them back because they are individually sealed and it's a huge pain.  this isn't the first time i have ordered food products from ""x brand"" & the items were close to the expiration dates ~ buyer beware! besides that downside i love these bars they are delicious (in my opinion a very healthy version of a rice crispy treat covered with dark choc) and the ingredients are excellent."

"cracked lid and torn adhesive. open your box immediately. usually this comes in perfect condition, but the last delivery had the lid cracked and part of the adhesive exposed.  unfortunately, i opened this box after the month return option expired as i always order early to have on hand.  i am now without and will have to purchase locally as i don't trust what the vitamins were exposed to during shipping due to the torn adhesive."

"$10 price increase from 35 - 45 within last purchase. i've been buying these for awhile now. they aren't bad, strawberry was an alright flavor, but must have been selling well or something as the price just bounced up $10 from 35 - 45 since june 11th. i've tried them all and it was my favorite, for the value, but with the increase in price, i'll be alright with vanilla. chocolate tastes like a protein bar, when mixed in water, strawberry  has a smooth texture and goes down easy, cookies and cream is pretty gag worthy, due to the chunks that are in them to attempt to replicate the ""cookies"" tastes. vanilla is alright. i mix them all via a blender. these last about 12 or so days with four scoops a day. these aren't really supplements i sit there and think, ""this tastes wonderful."" i chug them for protein; it's a supplement. but, i have had $80 supplements that tasted like fish oil, so this is an improvement. i've maintained 180 lbs over the past 13 weeks and lost pant sizes from lifting while maintaining a calorie deficit. if the prices increase any more, it's not really worth it, as there are other supplements out there that do the trick. but, if at least one of these 4.6 lb packages stays in the $35 range, it's a good choice."

pass.. waaaaay too hard and stale like.almost as if these survived an apocalypse...
not my favorite. i love solimo gummies! i would eat the whole bottle if i could. i do not love these. i will stick to the gummies which taste better and actually work much faster for me.
last a while. the scoop for it is huge and the serving size is way to much to drink at once.
costco is horrible. i paid 26 dollars to have this item shipped expedited. they took my money and the shipment took a week to arrive. the people who were supposed to get them had already left so now the items are lost. costco is horrible.
it finally got here.. my package was lost for a  while i guess.  i could get absolutely no response from these people.  it did eventually come but i will never buy from them again.
"honey tastes ok but packaging was a disaster. this is the second time i purchased this honey.  the first time i was very happy (5 stars).  it tastes just like honey and comes in a giant plastic squeeze bottle.  unfortunately, this time i can't give 5 stars.  unlike the first time that i ordered this honey, the honey was tossed in a big box (too big for the size of the honey container) where it was knocked around during delivery.  the cap to the honey broke.  broken pieces of the cap were inside the box and what was remaining to the cap was pretty much useless.  i don't think i'll be ordering this again.  :-("

"bitter with a strong aftertaste. i have ordered better liquid stevia 8 oz from now brand before and i love it.it is smooth and no after taste.i ordered the glycerin by accident. i just finished the liquid, opened up the glycerin and oh my word, it is awful! the after taste is strong and the taste is bitter.i wish i would have realized before the return window was closed. i now have 2 bottles of this stuff that i paid for and cannot use.don't be disheartened, the liquid is very good just make sure you get the liquid and the price for the 8 oz is fantastic."
can’t judge it. noticed no changes.. can’t fairly judge it because i have not noticed any changes.
swallowing. it kind of sticks to everything in your mouth so swallowing tends to get tricky!
products that are not damaged. one of the packages arrived ripped and i can’t figure out how to get a replacement!!!
"the jury's still out. i can swallow the pills with no problem although i still feel they are too big. i still have noticed any changes in my condition, even with regular dosage, and it's been over a month. taking this cause my physician recommended it."
"one star. i never got it on june 2,"
"our 8-year old with all of her teeth can’t chew threw these and neither can her mother!. we are huge garden of life fans. this was a massive disappointment.easy to swallow? well, they are chewable.chewables for “children 3 and older”. how?my 8 year old  could not get through them so she spit them into the garbage, so i gave it a go.you bite into it and it “snaps!” into two hard pieces. all you taste is lightly fruited oil, almost flax/linseed in pungent flavor (although it says cod?). my adult teeth continued to try to try to chew through the two hard outer casing pieces. this went on for well over 1 minute until it eventually started to dissolve in my mouth. kids are supposed to have four (4) of these a day?! i can’t imagine trying this in s 3- year old!"

expensive. it's an ok product but considering the amount you need in a serving it comes out rather expensive. flavor? chocolate peanut butter... where's the peanut butter flavor? not impressed really.
"awful taste!. awful taste, expensively priced!"
plastic bottle and we don’t find effective. plastic.my lady says she gets angry when she takes this?? and i personally don’t notice a difference like when we take solgar sublingual b12. just being real
"chemical bath for my mouth.. i have used bcaas from both optimum nutrition and xtend in the past and have been happy.  when trying this brand it felt like a chemical bath for my mouth.  the flavor is barely there, and needs to be diluted in more water than the instructions say to remove some of that chemical taste.  have been using for a couple months before posting review, would not buy this powder again."

"too much foam. i honestly expected something better! especially because it was made by a brand i consumed a lot. first and last time that i buy this specific product. there is absolutely too much foam after mixing the product with water so it makes it really hard to drink especially when i put frozen fruits with it, since it just becomes so dense and paste-like “liquid”. anyways, i wouldn’t recommend it if you are bothered with a lot foam in your whey.ps: the flavor supercharged strawberry is also pretty bad with water."

"received wrong flavor. i ordered vanilla ice cream, but received banana"
not for sensitive skin!!!!. the second ingredient is phenoxythanol which is harmful to people. it can cause lots of irritation to the skin.  why would you put that with baby wipes.  it wish i could return the rest of the packs.  i will not ever use them.  don’t buy these for your kids especially babies.
unpleasant. my husband was not a fan. much to large and an exceptionally unpleasant taste/smell.
do not order.. product arrived melted and stuck together. was not replaced or given a refund.

"something didn't agree with me. there was something in these that didn't agree with me. i'm on several medications, so there may have been some bad interaction. the bottom line is i took them for a week and felt awful."
food poisoning. this gave me food poisoning

"bad gas. i haven’t ever seen prebiotics with fos so i didn’t know to check the ingredient list for it.  i get bad gas from fos, inulin/chicory, that kind of stuff and it usually limits the types of fiber bars i can get.  i thought these probiotics were giving me horrible, room clearing gas, but it’s the fos.  i’ll go back to buying just about any other probiotic there is."

"not sure if they are the stated strength. i was on prescription vitamin d of this strength for 6 months; it was only plain vitamin d but had the benefit that insurance paid for it. rather than going back to the doctor when i ran out i decided to buy these. since i received the prescription vitamin d in the fall i could tell a difference since it was making up for the lack of sun exposure i was getting through the winter. there was a week or two span of time that i didn't have any pills between the prescription running out and this purchase. i felt a bit of a drop when i was off them, but no real difference pr pick me up after starting with these. i know that 5000 is one of the higher doses, so i'm wondering if these are really that strong. they are well within the expiration date so that isn't an issue. when this bottle runs out i'm going back to the prescription ones."

expired product. expired before they were even delivered.
"terrible ""x brand"" delivery. i've ordered numerous ""x brand"" items all delivered to the front door. this product was delivered to all the way on the other side of the house next to the trash cans. if it weren't it happened to be garbage collection day, this would have sit in the sun up to a week!"
customer service is what makes your customers happy.. bottle was delivered by usps and was left at my door broken and the box in a plastic bag. not the sellers fault but i did send them an email asking what i should do and didn’t hear anything back from them. still waiting for a response until then 1 star...
it works well but tastes gross. they look like balls of pink earwax. the taste isn’t much better. will be buying a different brand next time. taste aside they work great. i can always tell by looking at my skin if i haven’t taken them in a couple days.
do not buy. tested terrible very disappointed and charging me to return.
it was ok.. the flavor.
"motor stopped working after a month.... i was very happy with this diffuser when i first received it - it was quiet and efficient. it diffused oils well and i loved the look of the multi-colored changing light against the woodgrain. i would typically run this in half-hour intervals. however, after one month the diffuser started making a very loud, unpleasant sound upon turning it on. i think the motor already went bad, which makes no sense because i definitely didn’t overrun or overuse the diffuser at all. i never filled the water line above the fill line either...i’m really not sure what happened. i tried to continue using the diffuser even with the loud noise, but it completely stopped working now altogether. this wasn’t really a cheap item and i’m not happy. i thought now was a trusted brand since i was always happy with their oils...i’m hoping i can get my money back."

"garden of life has better unflavored options available. it’s a challenge to find whey free and soy free protein supplements, but garden of life definitely helps with that challenge. i wanted an unflavored protein powder that i could mix with whatever i wanted. i tried the raw protein and greens lightly sweet powder first and then decided to try the fit original. i mixed them with almond milk alone or with almond milk and fruit or peanut butter or chocolate syrup or even coffee (i know super healthy mixers). both powders mix well in a shaker. i prefer the raw protein and greens over the fit simply due to taste. the fit tastes like cinnamon and something else odd and overpowers everything else. i have to force myself to drink it because it’s too expensive to waste. whereas the slightly sweet raw protein and greens has no distinct flavor. both curb hunger equally so i see no difference there. i was hoping it would taste close enough to the raw protein and greens and i could enjoy having the extra protein, but it does not. i would not recommend this product when there are other options out there."

too sugary. this was one of the few d3/k2 chewable vitamins that had everything i wanted. and it’s from a brand i know and trust. my kids don’t complain. but i have tried them and they are overly sugary sweet. the sugar actually crunches on the outside when you chew it.
no results and rapidly increasing price with no apparent reason. no results and rapidly increasing price with no apparent reason

"strong smell and taste... not good.... the smell on these things... ick. you shouldn’t have to wash your hands after you touch a vitamin - and i can still taste it. these are awful and have a really strong smell and taste. not sure if i just got a bad batch, but i would not recommend."

"very good product, bad spray nozzle. this glass cleaner works well and smells fine, but the spray nozzle doesn’t work well toward the end of the bottle’s life making it very frustrating to dispense the product."

taste fine but gave me heartburn. unfortunately this supplement gave me major heartburn. beware if you have a sensitive stomach...
incomplete b's in this deal breaker for me.. iodine is great but not a complete b complex. no good for my little great granddaughter. they can do better than this. they need to read lets get well by adele davis and balance the b's.
taste. it did what it was suppose to do with giving me that extra energy but i did not like the taste.
"thick lotion. this lotion was really thick. i'm not a fan of really thick lotion. i put it on my hands that tend to get red scratchy looking marks when the skin is really dry and it didn't improve the look of my hands right away like some other lotions i've tried in the past. the container was a little weird in that it only would dispense lotion when you have the pump turned to the side. if you have the pump facing forward, it locks itself and doesn't dispense. it's a little awkward to remember that since it's natural for me to want to have the pump facing forward."
cypress essential oil. although the bottle seemed to be ok the oil on the inside was less than good. it smelled very rancid. there was not even a hint of fresh smooth cypress smell to what i had purchased.
"not helpful. tasted great, but did nothing to help with anxiety."
"horrible taste, horrible value for the money.. horrible taste, only 16 servings per 12lbs bag. too many calories in one serving. this works only if you want to get fat, not good for muscle building or burning fat."

use green extract cautiously. over priced product with little or negative value. green tea tastes ok if sweetened but in this product can cause upset stomach. check out risk vs reward with your doctor. ...jmaz

"more natural flavor choices. flavor was okay, could have gave me more of a boost."
didn't really work. tried this a few times and didn't really notice anything different maybe gave me a little more energy but nothing significant
this is not it. it just was not for me and all around was an average product. it does what is expected in regards to muscle recovery but the flavor is a big miss

pills are very large. these are too big for me to swallow
do not buy. i was sent a battery not the medication i ordered
"vanilla ice cream is terrible. the vanilla ice cream flavor has something leaving that synthetic, medicine taste after. regret buying the 5lbs of it."
it does not taste good. it does not taste good to me. kind of has an aftertaste. i would need to use a lot of it in my coffee to make it sweet enough.
"just too many big pills. this regimen requires 2 raw calcium capsules in the morning, 2 raw calcium capsules at lunch, then 3 strontium capsules on an empty stomach at night.  the calcium capsules have a slight plastic smell/taste. the 3 strontium capsules have no taste, but upset my stomach.  i really wanted to try this system, but just can't get past having to take so many large capsules, especially when it's an unpleasant sensation. also, don't know why there is a ""pain relief"" rate feature, because i don't think that is one of the product's claims."

"yummy gummy vitamin+keratin. a spendy treat that has more merit than plain gummy candies.. so i’m very health-conscious and try to take care of myself as best as i can. it’s important that i do so after years of abuse that i put my poor body through in the form of a life-threatening eating disorder. i crawled back from death more than a few times and now i’m finally in lasting recovery (knock on wood). i make sure i eat enough, exercise for health, and take a quality multivitamin (or right now, since i’m pregnant, prenatals). sometimes i add additional single vitamins on their own to boost what’s in the multi. (more doesn’t always mean better when it comes to vitamins, though, so do your research and/or check with your healthcare professional. and remember - a healthy diet is the foundation of good health! 😉)i am usually not a fan of gummy vitamins because they contain mostly sugar and the percentage of the vitamins are way too low. i call them “glorified candy,” lol. any gummy vitamin/supplement required you to down numerous gummies to equal the same amount in one capsule or tablet form. i decided to try these anyway because i figured since the percentage of vitamins aren’t too high, i could incorporate these into my pregnancy diet as an occasional treat and not overdo anything. i also liked that contain keratin.my bag of olly undeniable beauty gummy arrived very fresh and soft and i really enjoy the refreshing grapefruit flavor. i do feel like i’m treating myself to some candy when i eat these - and since candy is just empty calories, it’s not something i indulge in too often. but everything in moderation, right? 😉i think these (and gummy vitamins/supplements in general) are best suited for people who just cannot swallow pills/capsules or for people who never take any vitamins and feel that taking a couple of these a day will be better than taking nothing. like i stated a couple of times already, i don’t think the percentage of the necessary vitamins/supplement (in this case vitamin c, biotin, as well as keratin) are high enough to really do much on their own. at 2 gummies per serving and the bag being only a 30 day supply, it just isn’t a very cost-effective choice.i’m actually going to save the rest of these for after i give birth in september. in the postpartum period after i had my son 3.5 years ago, my hair fell out like you would not believe. it was completely distressing after having a thick, luxurious mane for the 9.5 months prior to his birth and i was so surprised i didn’t go bald. lol and 😡. (it really is amazing how much hair is on the human head. or maybe my hair loss looked even worse since my hair is long. in any case, losing all that hair is not something i want to experience ever again. shudder. 😖)i will continue taking my prenatals and add these olly undeniable gummy vitamins after baby girl arrives. i will make sure to update and let you know how things go. fingers crossed! 🤞"
"beware of seller xssential!. i had a very bad experience with the seller xssentail. it looked ok because his percentages were high like 95% of positive reviews. but when i received my oil thr lid was broke. ( check out my pictures). i thought the refund process was going to be easy and fast but it was not. the seller wanted me to return the product. but i didn't feel like i was responsible to return it because they wanted my time.  i really think they knew it was broken and sold it anyways. so i wasn't going to lose this battle. be careful when buying from the seller xssential. they might give you a big headache. who wants a broken lid where the oil would spill all over?? not me. after much battle the seller finally was forced to give me my refund and they did. not buying from them again.the oil is great though, i have purchased it before."

never buy again. the product didn’t give me energy . tastes badly . i threw it in the trash . definitely not worth the money .
did nothing.. did not do anything.  i was up all night long.
way too sweet!. was way too sweet. tasted like eating powdered kool aid.  they need to cut way back on their stevia or use none at all like they used to.
beware of mold!. i too got a bottle from a bad batch that started showing little dark speckles after a few months. i had been taking this product for years and never had any problems. at first i didn't think too much of it and continued to take it but over the course of the next month or so i started feeling more and more sick. went to the doctor several times and we couldn't figure out what it was. i noticed the spots growing and it was clear there was mold growing. i stopped taking them and threw them out and over the last 2 weeks have gradually felt back to normal. if you see anything besides pure white in the capsule do not continue using. i'm switching to another brand

"i wouldn't trust this brand if i were you.. i'm almost positive the lengthy post of how great this was is a paid writer.this product was bull shizzz.did absolutely nothing. not even on a 7yr old or with stomach cleansing pills for me.after the fake stories and sooo many ""bad batches"" of now products. im just gonna stop being so cheap and look for products that work."
"receive wrong products. i placed 2 orders of co-q10 100mg under 75 softgels. one order is with 9 bottles and the other order is with 11 bottles.i shipped these items to  express company who can help me ship to china.now i just receive the first parcel in china, the first 9 bottles. but what i received are all with 45 softgels per bottle.the other parcel which has 11 bottles have not yet received. i don't know what are inside it.now all items are in china. please advise how you can deal with this wrong order!!!i can only find this place to submit the pictures."
terrible aftertaste. they've added something to enhance or give the product a flavor which tastes like cheap candy.
broken. received shipment unfortunately 3 jars broken
dont buy!!. arrived melted and basically stuck to container it was impossible to get them.out
"6 month journal. 4/8/2019first day. took at 9am. on my way to the cafe i realized i had a huge need to exercise. i walked, for the first time around our campus, which is 1 mile - exactly. i've never done nor desired to do this. ordered a salad. going with three stars this month since it got me off my ass."
horse tablets meaning they are huge pills.. these are the largest pills i have ever tried to swallow.
did not work for me. returned after three days of use.
never got this. never got this
"works well but not a fan of artificial dyes. this is good for my bumpy skin on certain parts of my legs and the smell is decent and not overpowering. it lathers up nicely and leaves my skin feeling very clean. aside from that, i’m not a huge fan of the product containing artificial dyes. that is a completely unnecessary ingredient in a body wash."
yuck. does not taste good. must use ice cold water then drink it down quickly
"fair. does not disovle in liquids well, use d hot, cold and warm. plans to return to another brand purchased before.upon reading the back of container, because of where packaged i would of gotten as several of them i am allergic to several, it states made without dairy or soy yet package where those items are manufactured."
wouldn't buy again. chocolate flavor is kind of bland unless put in blender with ice and vanilla almond milk
"skip this one. i bought cinnamon cassia oil from now and it smells great. cinnamon ceylon from young living smells delicious, like cinnamon tea boiling in the kitchen. i bought this bottle from now because it's less expensive but it's just not as pleasant. it smells like cinnamon but it gives some cheesy notes that remind me of cheddar flavored potato chips. i usually buy from now because most of their oils are great and less expensive than other brands, but on this one, the aroma changes the whole experience."

huge to swallow. i’m cool with big pills but this one is big and wide...choke. i love the kirkland organic vitamins over these.

shipping was poor. shipping was horrible. bottles broke before arrived. sent back. repurchased and that shipment was a day late  the driver was rude
nasty gummies. i did not like the texture of this at all. it increased my nausea. i threw the bottle away.
didn't notice a difference. didn't help and haven't noticed a difference at all. it does lather well and smells good but it doesn't help the dandruff. i have heard that having dandruff might just be an allergy to sodium laureth sulfate so i am going to try using a shampoo without that ingredient and see what happens.

"really, truly tastes horrendous to me. i don't know if it's my genetics and/or how i perceive flavor, but this is one of the worst tasting foods i've attempted to eat. i want to be able to eat it given the nutrition packed in it, but it tastes like bitter dirt."

"very disappointed. i went sugar-free and searched for a variety of stevia products. i figured liquid would be good for my drinks. i like now products, and this had so many amazing reviews, so i purchased it. i only tried 1-2 drops in my coffee and bleh! bitter alcohol aftertaste. when i forgot how awful it was, i tried it again...this time in iced tea, and eww! same nasty taste.  just tried it again a third time after finding it on the back of my shelf...still a no-go lol.i'm surprised bc there's so many positive reviews about it having no aftertaste. my only thought is that i am a ""supertaster""...so perhaps i'm just more sensitive to the 11% cane alcohol it's dissolved in?  it's sweet...so there's that!i'm just sad bc i wasted money... but c'est la vie. it would've been a superb deal if i liked it. :)"

i have not received my order.. i have not received my order.
"not palatable enough. although i wasn’t expecting these to be delicious, they were a bit worse than i imagined—the worst part is the unpleasant lingering aftertaste. i was able to use these until pregnancy nausea kicked in and i couldn’t handle the taste of them anymore. i liked the idea of a chewable with fiber, too, and this seems to be the only option for that; unfortunately it’s just not worth it given the struggle to eat them!"
missing item. i ordered a 4 pack and one was open and missing inside the sealed delivery box.
sickly sweet!. sickly sweet!! only used once and could not handle the taste the flavor is very overpowering.

nasty 0⭐️. tastes terrible. i have tried 3 times to drink this and i can’t get it down🤮. leaves a chalky film in your mouth. does not blend well with almond milk. very clumpy. need to use a blender. mixes better with water. still 🤮
don't buy. didn't do anything for me
"scary side effects. my wife started taking these and almost immediately experienced dizziness and depression.  she stopped taking them and those symptoms went away.  a quick search of some of these herbals reveals some serious concerns out there about their safety and interactions with other things, as well as hormonal effects on women.  do the research, because the manufacturer didn't."
"nasty smelling. eww this stuff has a nasty stench, it's hard to swallow and has a blue dye. although, it is affordable it isn't worth it trust me. not to mention they don't even work. don't waste your money!"
broken bottle upon arrival. product arrived broken before i even used it the bottle was cracked. the package smelled a lot like eucalyptus before i even opened it
no effect. i bought this to increase my milk supply for nursing. it's been a few weeks and have not noticed any increase. tastes awful - even when swallowing whole with water.

"red yeast rice by now. i can't take these pills because they are too big.....i like the now brand, i've bought from them before but these are way too big, they choke me."
"prop 65. i ordered this over a year ago when my cat got fleas and thought i would try. didn't really work but whatever, it has other benefits so i continued to give it to her. this new one has the ca prop 65 warning on it. note, my cat was diagnosed with breast cancer at the end of august 2018 (started this the year before that). my fiance already opened it so i didn't attempt a return, just threw it out. my vet and oncologist advised that was the right thing to do."
"changed formula?. i’ve purchased this brand of minoxidil 4 times over the course of 5 months.i had really good results the first 3 times.however, this most recent time, i noticed the pack of 6 bottles were way less effective.i don’t know if the box was just simply a bad batch, or if they changed the formula.the consistency of the liquid in the most recent box i ordered was the same as the last 3, as was the smell. nothing seemed off.but the hair growth just was not the same as before.i haven’t changed anything, like dietary needs or my exercising schedule. everything’s the same.i ordered from a different company this time around (5th box) instead of the company selling this particular batch of minoxidil.maybe this new box will be the same as the first 3.besides the minoxidil not really working for me this most recent time, the first 3 times it worked like a charm.i saw many baby hairs forming within the first 3 months, then during the 4th and 5th month i saw thickening of the new hair that was growing. by the end of the 5th month my hair was thick and i had so much more of it. i couldn’t believe the change.this product does work, with consistency.i’d recommend buying from a different seller though."

tastes awful cant even hide it in smoothies. i really wanted to like this product to add a little extra fiber while on a keto diet but i just can't stomach it. mixing it with water is one of the most disgusting things i've ever had to drink. i tried adding just 2 teaspoons into a smoothie and it completely ruined the flavor. i couldn't disguise it no matter how hard i tried.
"quality went way downhill. last time i purchased this, around december 2017, it was delicious.  so delicious that i used it all in my smoothies, and ordered it again in april 2019.  it arrived opened and with glue fingerprints all over the top. ""x brand"" was nice enough to replace it for me.  the second one arrived fine... although the packaging had changed since i bought it in 2017, it seemed to be the same product.  i transferred it to a nice glass jar for my pantry... and then before i put it away, i tasted it!  absolutely disgusting.  i took several more tastes, to see if maybe it was my imagination... nope, it wasn't.  it tastes like chemicals.  it doesn't taste sweet at all, and it doesn't taste anything like stevia.  i doubt that this is even made from stevia leaves.  it tastes like ground up garden weeds with pesticides dumped on them.  it has no flavor, except the flavor of chemicals.  just terrible!  i didn't even bother contacting ""x brand"" about a refund for the 18 bucks i paid.  i just threw it in the trash, along with the first bottle, and i will never, ever purchase this brand again!!  if i could give this negative stars, i would... and i don't think in all the years i've been reviewing products here, that i've ever said that."
"two pills per serving- deceptive. 2 pills provides high dose of  omega-3 fatty acids, not one. so it has 45 servings of 2400 mg fish oil"
"last purchase seemed less effective than prior. not sure if they changed the ingredients or what, but the last order i received did not give me the energy or the ""tingly"" feeling that previous orders did.  i don't sleep well so i rely on a heavy ""punch"" from my pre-workout to get me through."
"meh. i wouldn’t buy it again. ever.. let me just say this, i honestly do use on amino energy almost everyday. my go to has been the strawberry flavor, but i decided to try this half lemonade and half tea because i live in the south and i need my sweet tea fix without all the sugar. my gosh, it is definitely a stretch to say this is lemonade...let alone tea flavor. it’s not disgusting. it just really sucks. so yeah, i’m a bit disappointed and will go back to buying my strawberry burst amino energy from costco."
"ok.. the gummies look good but they are a little bitter. there is slight aftertaste. not sure if i am noticeable more relaxed, maybe with time. i use it before bed to calm down from busy day and fall asleep faster."
"these are decent. not the best flavor in the world. i bought them to send to school for my sons snack. it worked. definitely not ranting and raving over them, nothing too special."
the first one. didn't work for me!!!
"melted mess.. do not buy this item from ""x brand"" if you live in a warm climate.opened the box 2 minutes after delivery, and it is a melted mess.not returnable to ""x brand""."
"melted mess.. do not buy this item from ""x brand"" if you live in a warm climate.opened the box 2 minutes after delivery, and it is a melted mess.not returnable to ""x brand""."
"exp. i received a box of expired bars. i messaged ""x brand"" gave a full refund and promises of a new unexpired box but i have yet to receive them."
"if you haven't ordered this in the last 3 months, it has changed. the fruit punch flavored one has changed, and rather drastically.  to the point where i don't even want to add it into my water bottle i carry at the gym so it doesn't leave that weird fermented smell it now carries.  does anyone have any solid suggestions on alternatives to try?"

"it sure is some soap.... honestly this was not great. i didn't realize there were microbeads in this and i don't usually buy anything containing them because they're just little bits of plastic that don't really do anything for your skin, but they do pollute the ocean and get into wildlife's food supply! microbeads aside though, i also didn't like the smell it was a little artificial and sweet for my taste, the consistency was oddly thick and it didn't really foam, and the salicylic acid is a bit strong for my skin now that i'm not having pubescent break outs anymore. it definitely feels like some store brand version of what i used to use in high school and honestly it didn't do me any favors the first time around. overall, it was a miss for me and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone but broke high schoolers. it sure is soap but not much else."
disappointing compared to b12. this tastes nasty and also doesn't spray well - its like its too thick or something. i love the b12 spray but this is awful.
it tastes terrible.. i was really looking forward to using this product for smoothies. it tastes absolutly terrible and stays with you for a really long time. it's like drinking a diet pop but way worse. i'm adding way more fruit than i wanted just to get it down.
upsets my stomach. does seem to help my neck some but after 2 days my stomach gets upset
"not for me. i don't think i will be purchasing this item again.  i usually like ""x brand"" brand items, but this one is a dislike for me.  there was no smell to it, and dried my hair out.  a plus is i received it on time, and at a good price."
not for everyone. i really wanted these to be it. i read through the bad reviews and thought there were so few it's be okay. sadly i am now just one of those bad reviews. there is an after flavor to these that just makes me feel so sick. i started not even chewing them. i would take chunks and swallow them. each time after i took them i'd break out with an itchy rash in-between my fingers. i've stopped taking them.

"big mess!!!. the product came with a busted top and oil spilled everywhere. i did not receive a return label so, i’m unsure where to return."
"rips and tears easily.. the bags are thin, rips before you can take them out of the garbage can. need a bag within a bag. i'm a ""x brand"" lover and wanted to purchase silomo brand for various products. sorry for the bad review."
"great, when the stars align.. i love these probiotics. i believe they do what they are intended to do for gut health. however, it's hit or miss as to whether they ""arrive cool"". they've never arrived to me ""cold"". this most recent batch arrived warm. ice pack melted and all. i'm hoping they still work as the hassle of sending back and trying my luck again seems futile."

"no results. i don't want to judge the product too harshly just based on my results, but no results...easy to apply at least, but i don't think i'll be keeping this up."
"work pretty good, but they're huge.. they work pretty good, no stomach upset and gives me a little extra energy. good daily value of each vitamin. they smell like maple syrup a bit too. but they're huge and hardly coated and i nearly choke everytime i take one. very hard to swallow. and i take pills with ease usually."

worthless. item didn’t work for me at all.

don’t buy from them!. i bought these april 2019  to bring as a present for my great grandma to a south american country and when i got there i noticed they expire may 2019. how can they sell these!? don’t trust them!!
advertised as having a dropper.. i dislike that once again i have received a bottle that does not include the dropper. this happened last time when i ordered the 2 oz. bottle. i thought that by ordering the 4 oz. bottle i could rely on this bottle to include the dropper.the picture shows a dropper. it is advertised as having a dropper that fits the length of the bottle. what do i need to do to be sure what i order is what i will be receiving.
they are dry and don’t wipe well. would not buy these again they are super dried out and kinda feels like sandpaper when i’m wiping my toddler even though he doesn’t complain about them
poor quality. poor quality taste like plastic mix in..!!!!!!🤮🤮

no help with bags. i tried this product for awhile and i think i have noticed a slight difference in fine lines around the eyes. i have not noticed any difference in my under eye bags. which is why i bought it.
"just-okay body wash. this is okay body wash. it smells nice enough.but the wash is thin and doesn't lather well.there is a lot of body wash in this container for the price. many people would consider that enough. for them, it's fine.but i do not like to see so many dyes and chemicals in an oatmeal-based body wash, which is a little less healthy than i'd like.i'm careful to avoid methylchorloisthiazoline and methylisohiazolinone. one or the other, maybe, but this product has both.true, scientific opinions on this ingredient are mixed. some organizations warn against use of this ingredient, which in high doses is said to affect the nervous systems of mice. others say that in very small quantities, it is safe for humans.i prefer to err on the side of caution. and while one of these ingredients would be okay, i'd rather not have a product that has both.i'll use this body wash, but i won't get it again."
"not so much about the product...didn’t receive.. not a review on the product...rather on ""x brand"" delivery.  tired of their “guaranteed” delivery dates and then...not delivered and it’s going to be days later.  if i wanted to wait, i would just go to the store...they are missing the point of convenience...just not happy.  wish they would get their delivery straight."

"don’t waste your money!. i hated everything about these wipes.  i was so glad when i used the last one.  the texture sucks, i feel like it did a terrible job of cleaning and i ended up using way more than i normally would."
"does not dissolve well - at all. i really enjoyed the quality of this collagen powder, but there is a distinct taste compared to comparable brands and it dissolves terribly and looks really gross.  seems like a small thing but there are so many brands out there offering better tasting and instant dissolve (i put it in my coffee, not a shaker bottle) that i won't buy this brand again despite noticeable benefits and quality."
"so disappointed.. completely changed formula . i loved these prenatals 4 years ago . since then  company has been bought by nestle and added vitex to this , which is not good during pregnancy. so sad garden of life sold out to a big company that can’t be trusted ."
"as a physician i can’t recommend this. better choices available.. this b12 is cyanocobalamin which may be toxic to liver. buy methylcobalamin instead.  also this pill has large amounts red dye which are also harmful. so buy organic. organic vitamins have to use natural food dyes and ingredients. it’s your body, spending a dollar or 2 more is well worth it!"

sick as a dog. i took one pill and got as sick as a dog...sending them back
work fine. works well
bad breath!. i guess they did what they're supposed to do i noticed no difference taking them so i ceased taking them. gave me very bad breath wife would not kiss me.

dont do it. i took a chance and ordered anyway. package came in a timely manner but we i received it the whole container was open and the safety seal was off. the powder covered the entire inside of the bag. waste of time and money. returning. will not order again.

"shipping issues. ""x brand"" needs to make sure the top is sealed and tight. some of the oil leaked out!!!"
"did nothing for me.. i saw no change in my skin, hair or nails. glad they work for some, but i got no benefit. they are easy to swallow."
"misleading description of product. it is not quantity 240 of 400 milligram pills!!! this is only 80 servings. we must be extremely careful when ordering from ""x brand"" but ""x brand"" doesn't make it easy to compare prices or compare items. you'd think if you searched on 400mg pills you would get *pills* not *servings.* the search results are all mixed up and you can't *refine* a search to get *exactly* what you are looking for."
"too sweet. these are too sweet.  when they are this little, it is even more evident how sweet they are.  i switched to bittersweet or 75% chocolate and have to hand chop if i can't find the minis - but the results in cookies is better."
"worse than every other bcaa i have tried.... i have a couple different brands of bcaas that i really like, but i hadn't tried the optimum version. on the whole i am a big fan of optimum products, i think they easily make the best whey protein and micellular creatine, but this product is just garbage.the flavor is pretty bad, but beyond that it is barely noticable (yes, i am mixing in the correct amount of water). so the flavor is super suttle, but also sub-par, so the overall flavor comes out like old nasty water. beyond this, i have never felt an immediate effect from bcaas before. usually they are something that i drink mid workout or during fasted cardio to stay anabolic and see better results overtime. this bcaa formula, however, hits me in a way that i can immediately notice. i get jittery almost like i am drinking a preworkout. ultimately not a good feeling. i have even had immediate changes in my vision, which is something i have not ever experienced from any supplement.overall i would recommend that optimum change this formula and i would recommend that you avoid purchasing. bpi best bcaa and ghost lifestyle bcaa are easily the best alternatives currently on the market and i would strongly recommend either of those competitors over this product.will not order again, but i do still love optimum as a brand for their superior whey protein and creatine products. hope this helps."

done.. this is the second time my order has had 1/3 of the pills busted. unless on shows that they have corrected the issue i’m going to another daily vitamin. they were great while they lasted but this shitty quality control has lost several customers from the reviews.
nasty taste. update: tried it a couple more times since my last review. it makes me gag. it's just sitting in my pantry. i'll just stick with the original. previous review: flavor not good...doesn't have much kick to it either

"missing 'use by"" date. i'm not sure if the best if used by date was removed intentionally or just faded away, but i'm hesitant to open this package and prefer to return it as there's nothing worse than very stale nuts!! i tried but the site indicates not eligible for return.  i could understand that if the food product was opened but that's not the case. also, interestingly, i compared the nutrition label on this package to the one i bought directly from costco a month ago and they're different (different levels of sodium, protein, etc.)."

"cookies and awfulness.. bought the cookies and cream one. per reviews, it was one of the best flavors available. it is no. it is obnoxious. i'm stuck with 5 pounds of something so sweet i would think i could get diabetes from just looking at it if i didn't know what the ingredients are. (and i'm not so sure of that either). i bought it with a huge discount at bodybuilding's website."

get to know the product first.. please verify with your doctor if this is okay to take if you have any chronic disease. it made me nauseous and vomit. apparently you have to have a 100% healthy.
ew. very chalky. bad flavor. doesn’t mix well.

"plasticky and uncomfortable feeling. i ordered these pads for my tween, and she absolutely hated them. we usually use always with wings, and she didn't expect much difference. but after the first day, she let me know that these were terrible. she said that while they absorb like they're supposed to, they feel very plasticky. she also said that they don't stick well. as a result, they bunch up and give you a wedgie--something she  doesn't want to experience ever, but most especially not during her period. she said she'd finish using what we've got, but  definitely doesn't want me to reorder these."
disappointed. love the scent!  disappointed that the dropper  inside the bottle doesn’t work.  now i have to purchase another bottle in order to use it
proceed with caution if affected by estrogen dominance issues.. dgl is not supposed to have most of the negative impact of licorice. this product was suggested to me by my integrative medicine specialist. i took two doses and started experiencing some very unwanted side effects related to estrogen dominance.
wrong item!. wrong item sent; granulated instead of powdered.  no return policy is stupid.  you sent me the wrong item!  won't ever buy from you again.
"didn't work for me. i was so excited to try these as i don't like swallowing vitamins and most vitamins you have to take with food. however, i guess my system is sensitive to something in these because i tried taking them both without food and with food and i didn't feel great each time i took them. i've taken gummy vitamins before with no problems but something about these made me not feel well. i have a friend who takes them though and she said they work well for her so i trust it's a good product, it's just not what i need."
not happy. i didn't know that i was allergic to fish until i started taking it.

do not buy from nutriplustea. the oils spilled all over the box and most of them were half empty. contacted seller nutiplustea and got no reply. do not buy
gross. it’s absolutely terrible
"flavor challenged.. it would be great i could get past the taste. packaging, delivery and quality were spot on."
second delivery issue. i still have not received a refund or the package. this is the second problem i have ran into when it comes to shipping.
would not buy again.. i like the scent and texture of other brands of wipes much better.

just ok. this cool mist scent body wash had potential and i had high hopes.  isn't often i am really disappointed in a body wash.  when i opened the bottle the scent was refreshing and natural.  when using it it did not take a lot to get a nice foam.  but there is one huge problem here.  the body wash does not really seem to clean.  it is a weird thing to say but after exercising a few days in a row i used this body wash and not my regular.  the scent smells good from the bottle but it does not provide a refreshing clean scent to the body.  hate to say it seemed as if i had not showered at all.  in no way was my body clean and fresh smelling after using this body wash.  i cannot recommend this body wash at all.

"awful smell & burns my eyes. i've ordered this same brand of lavender before and loved it. this order was actually just to provide me a 2nd bottle, so i could have one in the bath and a 2nd in the bedroom. the first bottle smells wonderful. i just opened this bottle and it has a terrible smell. it actually burns my eyes when i use it in my diffuser - very disappointing. i usually am very happy with now products..so i'm  not sure if it's a manufacture quality issue, or the vendor who filled this order."

they sent me the wrong product!!!. i ordered the fish oil and a box of tea arrived at my door. wtf. says no returns and there isn’t anyone to contact. very unhappy as i’ve been a regular customer for years. not anymore.

"this is a product that is about to expire. the products purchased are all about to expire, and they will expire after they are bought."
"awful taste!. this product looked good on paper, but i can't get past the taste. it's awful! no matter what i add to improve the taste, it's not drinkable. i wish i'd never bought this; it's going in the trash. a waste of money."
almonds. tasted stale
brown spots. i have been using nac for years. different brands. have never encountered brown spots... until this bottle. gross!
new formula makes me ill. i've used c4 for a while. the older formula where the powder had color before mixing with water tasted better and did not make me ill. the newer formula makes me sick and tastes like it is not something that should be ingested.
terrible taste - don't buy it. probably the most rancid tasting powder i've had to date. i has taken me a week to be able to stomach it. i still feel like i have to gag it down. would not recommend
"the taste is not good. the artificial sweetener and chalky tastes are strong in this protein shake. the only thing chocolate in this powder is a resemblance of color to hot chocolate powder. my doctor recommended this shake as a meal replacement. i’m sure the nutritional value is good, but i can’t bring myself to  drink it."
"good product, but very poor packaging and quality control. the quality control and packaging for this product is very poor.  the lid will not stay closed, and several of the capsules are opened, leaving powder all over the bottom of the container.  i have ordered this product at least twice and the problem has been the same both times.  this means we definitely are not getting the number of capsules we are supposed to have in the container.  the product itself is a good one.  please do something about your packaging and quality control!!..from a pharmacist..."

"nope.. the amount this bottle tells you to take per day is ridiculously high. you are only supposed to have 1800mg's per day! i didn't know this until i started taking a tab per day and began having huge side effects. i started getting dizzy and having ""brain zaps"". it got so bad, i had to see my doctor and she was horrified at the recommended dosage on the bottle. just be careful. check with your doctor first."

horrible. tasted like it had been stored for years very old tasting. will not buy again. back to cellucor for me
good product but. not a bad product but certainly does not dissolve completely. it’s not particularly pleasant to drink

ehhh. i didn’t care for this flavor.... has a funky aftertaste
no dental consequences. mediocre flavor
do not buy!. made me break out after a week of using
do not purchase from this seller. do not purchase from this seller! jars were broken open and leaked inside the box (for who knows how long). this seller does not allow returns/refunds so i am out $26.10... absolutely terrible customer service!
tastes like stevia. tastes so awful. they added shit ton of stevia like product and drinking just one scoop gave me shivers. absolutely hated it and had to return it. avoid it unless you love the stevia flavor

"didn’t work as i intended it to be. wanting sleep so bad with having to stare at my ceiling for hours. this product from olly did not impress me with this product, every time give it another try i get weird dreams and somehow stay up longer than i should.when i give it a rest for a day or two i notice my sleep pattern is different without the weird dreams.*taste*the gummies do really taste good but for what it’s worth, i don’t recommend"

great product / but brought acne. broke me out bad ! great product .
no iodine in the salt  huge problem. iodine is essential and is added to salt. the us government was going to require (years ago) salt companies to add iodine and they agreed to voluntarily do it to avoid regulation. now sea salt is so popular but people are unaware of the absolute necessity of getting iodine in their salt. this salt has none. i have bought it and i am returning it to costco where i bought it. i will seek out iodized sea salt (which is available.)
"black dots inside capsules. the worst product i ever bought on ""x brand""!!! the capsules went black dots after 3 weeks of opening the bottle. gross! i just spend my money for this. don’t buy it."
"broken& empty capsules...what a rip off!. broken & empty capsules, upset stomach"
"broken& empty capsules...what a rip off!. broken & empty capsules, upset stomach"
they work great. but they stick together so i have to use a spoon to get them out of the bottle.
"bad option for me. has ingredients that are very harmful to the human body, i would stay away."
did not work as well. i am 11 months postpartum and have taken a dha/fish oil supplement and prenatal vitamin since becoming pregnant. i wanted to try a less expensive fish oil and drop my prenatal vitamin. i did not feel like this supplement helped manage my anxiety nearly as good as the rainbow light brand. i will be going back to their supplement.

no flavor at all. states vanilla flavor? not even close. if you like chalky protein shakes godhead. i will never buy again.

below average. lid is flimsy and doesnt like to close or open. stick to blender bottle brand.
sweetened with stevia - horrible aftertaste. yuck!  i did not realize this was sweetened with stevia or i never would have purchased it.  took one sip and through the entire can away.  cannot get the horrible aftertaste out of my mouth.
"these people absolutely suck. one bottle of my two bottle order went missing due to bad packaging. the only responses i get from the seller are auto responses. ""x brand"" has not been helpful. dealing with this has turned into a career. buy from another seller."

"eh. . .. for being a woman's vitamin, it doesnt have substantial amts of what you'd expect (calcium, vit d, folic acid, etc.) i didnt notice any difference in how i felt or looked (shiny hair, etc) despite being over halfway done with the bottle. tastes like candy. is this even healthy? i'm unsure. switching to a prenatal despite not being pregnant."

"blue razz. yikes, stay away from the blue razzberry. the flavor is yucky. i tried it because it was cheaper  than the watermelon, but i think i'll stick with the watermelon!"

"bad stomach pains & can't return, &upset. after taking this since february, this product now gives me trouble stomach pains & confusion. it has actually made me have mood swings & anxiety so much worse than before taking this. i took it with food 2x daily. i noticed my moods have been better since i quit taking this within 2 days. my stomach pains & i do mean very uncomfortable cramps & stomach pain is gone as well. i really am upset with this & wish i could get a refund if i return the remaining pills and bottle."

ewwww!  i guess if you like dirt tasting cake batter this is for you!. oh my what can i say. well it tastes like dirt filled cake batter. nasty tasting. gritty and does not mix up very well.  i just can’t make myself drink it 🤢
outdated product. i just received 2 large jars of 360 gummies that expire in one month. it will be hard to take that many gummies in one month.
missing package. never received item.

"stale. i've bought these before and i love them, but the last container's chocolate coating was hard and stale tasting"
"horrible side effects. i should have done a better search. i took this for one week and felt sick, nausea all day, major headache, my throat was tight the whole 8 hours, it made me break out so bad and gave me chills. even thou i was taking around 7 am i still couldn’t fall asleep at 10pm.  i know each body works different, but for me it did not work. just stick to a healthy eating and exercising and you’ll loose weight. i don’t think i would recommended this to anyone."

"purchased when first came out, worst protein ever. i bought these when they first came out like 2 years ago...? unless they changed their formula/recipe these are the damn worst tasting abominations i have ever tasted in my life. i purchased a box of red velvet and birthday cake i tried 1 package each and could barely eat them they were absolutely disgusting!i'm a bodybuilder type, will eat anything that meets my macros, protein etc even if it tastes like garbage i would still get it down..... but these nasty ""cakes"" i threw away. i have never thrown away protein bars in my life, so since i threw them away that says something about how nasty they were. i wanted to like them. optimum nutrition is always top notch and i get them for most things including whey protein and casein, and serious mass, but these ""protein cakes"" are down right inedible. so unless they changed their recipe they are garbage."
i don't believe there's any caffeine in this.. i've been taking this for three months and have not noticed a difference...
"contains stevia (discrepancy between vega site and ""x brand"" listing). i know i should have read closer but on the vega website it doesn’t display “stevia” on the ingredient list. i have prime so obviously looked up the product and purchased. upon opening and reading the container “stevia” is listed as an ingredient. i’m not sure if maybe there was an ingredient change overlap but am pretty bummed out of this. i’m allergic to stevia and have found it nearly impossible to find any brand that sells a vegan and non-stevia protein powder."
not for me... not that effective
"nasty side effect. this does help me stay asleep, however i. priced bad spells of vertigo. wasn’t entirely sure what was going on. got checked out and nothing seemed wrong. i forgot to take this a few days in a row and my vertigo stopped. i haven’t taken it in over a week and have had no vertigo symptoms since."

worst taste ever. i've tried monk fruit crystals/powder before and they were great. this liquid is awful!
melted- useless. my item arrives as a bag of melted chocolate. useless now...since i wanted to make cookies. so annoyed.
"need to take 3 a day. i'm not impressed. comparing these to the current gummy vitamins that i take, these under perform. with these you have to take 3 a day so the bottle is only a 30 day supply. there are 35 calories, 8 grams of carbs, and 6 grams of sugar. this is over double of my current vitamins. there isn't as much percentage of each included vitamins and minerals. the gummies are harder and to me, they aren't great tasting. also be aware that these contain no folic acid. if you are of childbearing age, folic acid can be important. i would not purchase these again."
never arrived. never arrived
do not buy. i did not notice any changes. i consumed as suggested on a daily basis and even doubled my intake and still did not notice any changes. i would not reccomend buying this product.
not worth the money. i wish these made me feel different. was really hoping for lactation and mood support as promised. i did not notice any lactation support and they smell and taste so bad! like worst pill i’ve ever smelt!

"no iron. i told my doctor i was taking prenatal and she said, "" i hope they're not gummies because the won't have iron!"". too bad because they taste really good. but they need folic acid and iron otherwise they're just a multivitamin."

"fish size!. price was better than my local stores.  i wish that they had these capsules in a smaller size with the same mg.  they are very difficult to swallow and feel like they are stuck in the back of my throat.  since they are capsules, they can't be cut due to the liquid."

product tampering or poor qa?. got towards the bottom of the bottle and found 8 capsules split in half. poor quality assurance or product tampering? check your contents before using.
"didn't really notice any difference.. your results may be different, but i really didn't notice any difference while using this product."
expired product. i bought 400 tablets. they expire in october of 2019.  more than half will be expired before i can use them.  returning. very disappointed.

terrible smell and after taste. horrible taste and smell. i have been taking saint john wort for many years and never ever experienced anything like this before. i thought the smell is going away if leave the cap off but that didn’t help. i’ll never buy any now products again. unless i receive an apology and my money back.
"lacks flavor and thickness.. sorry, i really wanted to to like this because i love the garden of life vitamin line. i switched from huel because this is cheaper. but this protein powder falls short in flavor and consistency is watery.i'm switching back to huel."
"have to buy a better quality vitamin d3, wasted my money. i am allergic to these and get a rash when i take them"
"salt shakes. this should be called a salt shake rather than keto.  for the positive, it is a very fine powder that makes it blend well and easily even without a blender.  the initial smell and very first taste remind me of those peach ring gummies, which made me excited since i loved those as a kid.  however, all resemblances end there.  after that initial brief taste, all you will taste is salt.  you cannot even get the peach flavor again after that very first taste.  looking at the label, it is sincerely full of salt.  i couldn't even take another drink of this stuff.  even now i cringe and gag a little at the memory of the taste."
taste nasty!. they taste is absolutely disgusting!
new formula has foul taste. recently changed formula tastes horrible.
so..so... not as good as the liquid kind
"stinky! very potent. i’m sure it would help my little one but it smells terrible. it actually smells so bad that i refused to even try it. so i would not give to my baby if i thought it stunk so bad.glass bottle with dropper top, easy for daily use.cannot return after opening."

"trash. i don't like this brand.  is this made with motor oil?  their b vitamins do little.  i switched and found i felt great taking vita code.  i bought now for years and wondered why i felt like garbage.  their vitamin c is ascorbic acid, this is a man made chemical derived mostly from gmo corn and starch that has no vitamin c in it anyway, not only is it a gmo and bad for you but it has no vitamin c in it.  ""l""-asorbic acid is a whole food derived, true vitamin c.  i switched and did a flush with this and after a week i feel amazing.  if a company is misleading like this i don't trust them with anything.  and their b vitamins suck."

doesn’t work for me.. i subscribed this product and used it for almost two bottles as said in instruction. my nails keep peeling as showed in the picture. maybe it only doesn’t work for me.
pictures on website is misleading. the bottle was way too small from the description.
"tastes good but gave me upset stomach. typical erythritol issues. it's pretty much the only sweetener that comes close to sweetening stuff like sugar without that weird aftertaste, but it upsets the stomach afterwards. if you're one of those few people that don't get ibs after eating erythritol then i recommend this one."

"dirty liquid leaked inside. [[videoid:41abbf8c06ec49caae39d53b3060bf33]] i bought this item on april and just opened it today and found something leaked inside. i checked every each capsule, none of them broken, i don’t know where the dirty liquid from, i don’t feel like it is safe to eat. i discard the bottle , it worth 13.99$. i would like a refund if it possible."
"terrible new flavor. i used to love the berry vega hydrator and swore by it for years. now that they altered the flavor, the taste is frankly pretty disgusting. it’s always sad when a company decides to cheapen the quality of products and lose customers as a result."
"seriously disgusting. the flavor of this protein was super super gross, gritty, and chalky. i would not recommend! i'm not a picky person either, but this stuff was just so so hard to drink. might i add, i got food poisoning after consuming this product... it was terrible. never purchasing anything from optimum nutrition. never ever ever ever ever ever!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"tastes awful, very little chocolate flavor. i really disliked the taste on this one, even after adding cocoa powder i wasn't able to get it to taste like chocolate.  very light on flavor.  if you are looking for more of a 'hint of chocolate', this might be for you."
"mild flavor. i would never rate this chocolate better than average. if you want chocolate flavor to stand out in your dessert, don't buy this. if you want it to quietly complement something that it is mixed with, then you will be happy. i used it to make almond joys. it was mild, which i think work nicely to not over power the coconut"
too much sugar. this product has way too much sugar. it’s gotta be the worst vitamins in the market
where is my package. i never receive my package 😩
not again.might work for you but not me. same old stuff deffrent pagageing. made my stomach hurt
this stuff destroyed my stomach. this product was absolutely horrible on my stomach. i literally felt like i swallowed a toxin. waste of money.
"bad taste, tons of sugar, low energy. tastes terrible, and has a ton of sugar per serving (13g is nuts). and beyond that, provides very little of an energy push or endurance help.  so it fails at the 3 things that the people who buy this kind of product care about. and i only use natural pre-workouts. tossed this after less than half a container used."

scent was bad. it really did not smell good. could not use.
"very poor ""x brand"" service!. terrible ""x brand"" service!  this item was miss-delivered, yet ""x brand"" will not make it right!  i am furious over this!  i never got this item!"
doesn’t work! waste of money!. doesn’t work at all. have been taking it for over 2 months now. inaccurate description.
yuck!. i'm so glad i decided to purchase the small tub of this to try it before buying more. i have tried it twice and can barely choke it down. it's gritty and doesn't really have much flavor at all. i don't know if i'll be able to use the rest or if i'll just have to toss it. the thought of trying it again makes me shudder. i'll have to find a product that is more palatable.
arrived damaged. gave only 1 star due to the products seal was broken.
mine wasn't sealed!!!???? no seal for protection on the lid are kidding me.. of course this happens when i buy a 228 servings one. anyone could've put something in there. never ordering again and do not recommend. what a waste of 30 bucks.
bad taste. the product contains carnauba wax. the wax taste and texture is very strong.

"leaky, high priced for what you get. these weren't as absorbent as i had hoped.  the leg and waist fasteners often fail.  if they were half price i might see value. given that they are iny oennys less than national brands they aren't a good value"
ick. taste horrible and they get mushy in the bottle ugh should have sent back😫
"did not recieve. i have not received this package. tracking says it was delivered 2 days ago and left in a parcel box, apparently not mine.disappointed."
"too sweet for me. i think these would be better if no sugar was added.  if you like sweet, you'll probably like these, but they're too sweet for me."
texture and flavors are awful. i like a good gummie but these are just icky. they feel slimy in your mouth and immediately begin to dissolve ... no gumminess at all. i wouldn't recommend them.

"gave me headache. don't know what's up with this product. i don't know how to contact the seller. i would love a refund bc this product doesn't improve focus, all i'm left with is a terrible headache!"
"better packaging for shipping vitamins. i cannot review the product yet since the box was somewhat crushed, bottle was broken, and pills were all loose. hope replacement bottle is in much better shape so i can actually use the vitamins :-(."
too sweet. too soft. doesn’t taste good. too sweet. too soft. doesn’t taste good.what else is there to say?
"tastes bad.. tastes like medicine, not good at all."
"tastes bad.. tastes like medicine, not good at all."
made me very sick. i researhed so much to find the right d3 and i really need to take it so im so sad i've had such difficulty finding a good one. i only took one of these and was extremly sick to my stomach the rest of the night. i'm sure it wasnt the food i ate because my husband and i had the same meal. it had to be the d3 and it was already too late to send it back. i'm so bummed!
not a good flavor. does not have a good flavor at all.

"not as good as i expected. i like to buy ""x brand"" brand products because the are usually great. these rolls are big & you get a lot of them. but they don’t last as long as i expected.  we went through over a roll a day, usually a roll lasts us at least a day and a half if not two days. i wanted to love it, but that aspect of it disappointed me."
pretty cheap and really big in size. these are really big. i wouldn't say they are 32-44. more like 40-44. the size material is really thin and the velcro tabs don't stick very well. they are pretty bulky also and not very discreet.
eh. i'm not a fan of the flavor but its also hard for me to think any cream flavor is good unless its done right. but all my other vitamins are vitafusion so the brand its self is great!
"felt nothing. this stuff use to keep me going, but not feeling anything from this stuff anymore. loved the flavor but did not get the results i was hoping for. probably not buying anymore. but if i give it another shot will update."

"it's awful this time - tastes bitter. i've used this for years and years and bought plenty from ""x brand"".  it's bitter this time.  almost undrinkable.  mixing everything the exact same way i always do."
rancid. these pills smell rancid. the ingredients are clearly separating and discolored. apparently 2018 was not a good year.
bad flavor. these are the grossest tasting gummy vitamins. they taste like medicine .

"very hard on the digestion!. i try to avoid supplements whenever possible and get my nutrients from food, but i cut back on dairy recently and figured i'd give calcium supplements a try. this seems to be a reputable brand, but oh my goodness these supplements have been awful for my stomach. without going into any unseemly details, my digestion is usually quite normal and predictable, and these pills have just messed up my whole system. i stopped taking them for a week, everything got back on track, and i took one today just as a test. ooof, i'm already feeling like crap again. definitely going to have to take a loss on these and throw them out."
very distinct flavor.... most accurate description of the flavor is: crushed flintstone vitamin
"quality issue. product arrived damaged, all the gummies were stuck together & this did not sit out in the sun. i was home when it was delivered."

"a fairly well known brand. with any supplements you don't really know what you're getting since there seems to be no govt. regulation of the industry.  but this is a fairly well known brand, and i suppose it contains what the label says, more or less.  at least i hope so.but i find that these capsules give me heartburn, a pretty severe case, unless taken just before or with a meal.  so there's that.."
melted vitamins. i am very disappointed due to the fact that my vitamins are completely melted and look like soup. i was able to salvage the other two in a sense by putting them in the fridge but the womens vitamins not happening it's one huge blob.
gross. taste disgusting. first time buying this and it tastes horrible.
weird flavor. why does this taste like coconut--artificial coconut? i don't like it.

tmg adds the chalky flavor. the chalky flavor you're tasting is the tmg. it's good for you but yeah i understand why you won't like it. i dont either but its bearable and for the price it's good. plus i like the brand. local in florida and i dont mind supporting their business.
"leaked in transit.. product was fine, but leaked during shipping. surprise because it was so well padded. i had to throw one bottle out."
expired shakes. beware! this vendor sells expired product. what a complete waste of time.
"super sweet and expensive. too much stevia, too sweet and bad aftertaste.too many ingredients, about 50!the tub looks big but it’s less than 1/2 full. the scoop (serving size) is huge. only 9 servings in the small tub.it vaguely taste coconut, artificial.the price drops from $25.49 (small tub) when i bought it last week to $19.88 today."

delivery not received. i've checked my order and it says it was delivered in my mailbox. it must have been someone's mailbox but not mine. this order was never received. i don't see anywhere that gives me a way to contact the seller. this seems to be my only avenue. i'd appreciate help in resolving this. i've cancelled future orders as this system doesn't seem reliable.
"gross, money wasted. i don't know if its just me but the vanilla is absolutely disgusting. i tried everything i could think of to make it better, but whatever i did the manufactured taste stayed. i ended up throwing it out after a few days because i couldn't get it to taste good."
"not authentic. i took this for over a week, and my night time leg cramps have come back with a vengeance. if this was legitimate magnesium citrate that would not have happened. my body let me know this is not legitimate. god only knows what's really in it, but it's not magnesium citrate."
does not work. avoid.. does not work at all.
they’re lying my item was not delivered. i never received my item where/why it’s there a space for items not received but carriers states it was delivered because they’re lying my item was never delivered i want my item or refund!!!
the container is half full.. i like this product for the quality of raw organic sprouts for my added  protein in my green smoothies.  i purchased the unsweetened which i like. i do not like that the container is half full when i get it and i half to dig down to find the scooper. i doesn’t taste great but i can add different vegetables or fruits to add flavor.  i will keep buying it until i find another one i like better.
"bad. i opened a brand new bottle, and 90% of the bottle is cotton"
"sold out. cannot abtain the natural / non artificial flavors version of this anymore. i’m sure they changed the formula to increas profit, but i will not be buying any of there products at all now that they are a profit over quality company. if you scroll through the pictures in the reviews there’s a guy who spotted the change in ingredients and explains the whole deal, disappointed"
"over priced gummies. have followed the instructions to the letter, have seen no improvement in my sleep."
"over priced gummies. have followed the instructions to the letter, have seen no improvement in my sleep."
"very disappointing. when i received this product, it was a melted gummy ball stuck to the roof of the lid.  there is no gummy fruit singled out. i was very very disappointed because what am i supposed to do?, ""pinch a piece of the gummy ball per day?"" failure at it's finest!!!"
"packaging is horrible, product is great!  :-\. this is an amazing product & it keeps me calm, so much i cannot live without it now after months of taking it, but the last two bottles i received have leaked thru the top of bottle/bulb, constantly leaving the tincture dripping down the sides & under the bottle. not good for the price per bottle. i think i may need to try another company. sucks."
taste horrible. this product taste awful! i was at costco... saw the sale. . quickly checked the reviews... seemed decent... purchased it and sad to say that this seriously taste horrible! im not one that returns stuff... but i seriously cant even force myself to finish a serving. :(
"ehh.... i notice no difference. even bought these from target, been taking for months and dont believe the sales pitch for this product . maybe need to take them longer ?"
"unbelievable waste. for a box of chocolate bars, this shipment resulted in three layers of plastic, 4 ice packs, almost 2 yards of insulation all for a non-perishable item.  i felt sick to my stomach looking at the voluminous waste for a stupid box of chocolate bars.  change your packaging or i find another supplier."
sent wrong product i want the product i ordered. they sent me the wrong product. i ordered like i always do the highest grade fish oil one ultimate omega 2x. they sent me a plant based vegan omegas!?!? oh great i can return if i want to be inconvenienced and have to pack and take to mail service

"i didn’t receive the item i paid for. i’m tired of ""x brand"" short changing me.. i didn’t recieve the product i have already paid for. ""x brand"" has cheated me again."
"shitty packaging and delivery. i cant even tell you how this product is because when i opened the box, the oil was spilled all over. will never buy again."
will not buy again!!!. didn't notice different. taste okay
"poor quality control. i gave these an overall poor review because one entire pack of diapers i received was faulty. the top gauze-like outer layer is detached from the back of the diaper, exposing the plastic. we live in the low country where our youngest is often in just a diaper and t-shirt because of the heat, but you can imagine how uncomfortable it is to hold a bottom covered in hot plastic on a 100° afternoon in june."
was hoping for better. maybe it was the watermelon - but too sweet and better products out there for the money
"this is not protein powder. i've been notified by a protein seller that if the protein container is not sealed than its not legit. do not buy this product,  its most likely someone took the container from a trashcan and filled it with something else."
"tasty gummy vitamins. i have been using this brand of vitamins for years. i saw them on ""x brand"" so thought i'd give ordering a try. i'm not sure what could have happened but...they tasted good but slightly different, and were a completely different color than any of the ones i've seen in pharmacies, target, or the grocery store. it could have been temperature changes during the delivery process, but it creeped me out..so i will stick to buying them in person.i still recommend these brand of vitamins, just choose where you buy them from at your own discretion."
"screwed up. ""x brand"" is screwing products. they sent hydrocortisone anti inch cream in instead of the allergy pills.  it’s poisonous so not easy to swallow. probably not a good flavor. can’t be returned as wrong because ""x brand"" will not accept return."

allergy. this product caused an allergic reaction on my skin.
yuck!. the smell on these are so strong that it makes it hard to use. 😱
fake c4 product. this is a fake product. literally taste like coolaid and no caffeine effect. frustrating.
naw.... they turn a funky color very quickly. i put them in a pill caddy. turned within a week. not a fan.
pass on this flavor. flavor is not that great.  price was cheap so gave it a try.  i’m not picky at all.  i would pass on the flavor
"the texture is unbearably disgusting. the taste of this isn’t bad but the texture is absolutely disgusting. it’s like drinking snot. it’s lumpy, slimy, thick, and gross. i can usually drink or eat anything. i don’t mind drinking bad tasting green drinks when i know they’re good for me. but this literally made me gag on the first sip. it’s that bad. i can’t even drink it."

"ineffective, tastes like cough syrup.. this is juice that tastes like medicine. i threw it out."
"smells horrible. i usually buy neutrogena coal tar shampoo (which smells like strong chemical/medicine scent) so i decided to try another brand. this one was very cheap compared to the brand name, but i only used it once due to the terrible smell. it still had the strong chemical/medicine scent of coal tar but they tried to add a powdery/perfume smell to mask the other. the two smells together was overpowering and stayed in my hair for a long time."
a bad drink indeed. too well ground almost into dust.  i prefer a much coarser cut.  it's disgusting to add to water and drink.  i dumped this waste of money and went back to my other psyllium seed from india.

"too many broken pieces. buyer beware -- i've ordered these pretzels twice.  the first time, the container was perfect with almost all of the pretzels intact.  the second time i ordered them, approximately half of the pretzels were broken into little pieces.  and the pretzels were stale in the second order.  if i knew the pretzels would be fresh and shipped without being broken into little bits, i would order them again.  they are delicious.  they need to do a better job of shipping them."

not for me. disgusting.. i hate the taste.
creepy seller. there was an open package of frito lay chips in my package along with a melted ice pack. why i just wanted my vitamins. so weird
would not recommend. did not work
stick to vanillas and chocolates. love the chocolates and vanillas and have gone through countless big containers but the strawberry was gross

super sweet. the gummies were so sugary and soft i ended up throwing them away and getting a different brand.
defective product. most of the trash bags in the box i received  were severely damaged at the seams and of an inferior quality.
did not work for me.... i am struggling with being able to go to bed. i followed the instructions and still could not fall asleep in a timely manner. took 2 gummies at 9pm hoping to be asleep by 10... ended up finally falling asleep around 1:30am. i will not buy these again/ recommend them.

mk4 works better for me. i believe they are not strong enough even if you take 2-3 a day. i wasn't doing as well as i did on 15 mg of k2 mk4. i know the mk7 has a longer life than mk4 but the potency is not enough for my metabolism. so i went back to the mk4 15 mgs. i can tell that works because my teeth are a lot cleaner/smother with no calcium build-up. i didn't get this with the mk7. we all metabolize supplements different. not saying it will not work for others.
the sellers didn’t ship timely and shipment got lost. 0
"vitamins good, ""x brand"" bad.... i've taken these vitamins for 2 years and i think they're about the best bang for the buck, but... the last two times i've ordered them they were advertised as ""prime"" with two day shipping.  order confirmation says they miiiiight get here in 11 days or so. stupid me just noticed this so i'll have to wait another 5 days to return them as a matter of principle.  i think i'm done as a prime customer.  the whole prime experience, as far as consuming products, rather than streaming media, sucks lately. peace out!"
you wont feel a thing. didnt feel any different. had no effect on me whatsoever.
blends great but the flavor is awful.. blends great but the flavor is awful. nutiva pea protein in vanilla is way better tasting.
"beware mct oil. so i read up on ubiquinol and how it is imperative it is that anyone on statins take ubiquinol to replenish what is lost by just using those prescription drugs - 'if you are over 20, your body can't properly process coq10 so you should take ubiquinol'.  i read on dr. weil's page how i should pre-load to build up my plasma, taking 300 milligrams for two weeks then 100 milligrams afterward as a normal dose.  why the long introduction?  look up mct and light headed and see what you find.  here i am taking three of these each morning, feeling like crap, dizzy, light headed, off balance and wondering what was wrong until i searched for the ingredients and the mct oil stuck out.  just be careful...just when you think you find a good product."

"flavorless. i like the gold standard brand and salted caramel is one of my favorite flavors of anything so i was excited when i saw they had this one! however the taste is very subtle and doesn’t have a distinct caramel flavor at all. it’s okay, but not going to purchase this flavor again."
never again. i used it for soapmaking in 2 different batches of cold process soap. ruined both. i’ve never had a bad batch. it’s this oil.
awful smell/taste. my kids gagged when they ate them! the smell and initial taste is awful! wasted my money because no one will use them.

"headaches and green urine.. these vitamins gave me headaches whenever i took them as well as greenish urine. the energy boost was not a natural energy boost. i felt as if my heart was racing, i was jittery and anxious."
"two things pissed me off. first of all, the scooper was at the very bottom of the product. i know this is a common complaint for most powdered supplements but that doesn’t make it okay. like tie it to the lid or something... innovate.while i was digging my hand throughout the product trying to obtain the scooper, the smell of stale maple syrup filled the room. i bought the cookie dough flavor. sure enough, this product tastes nothing like cookie dough.. if anything it tastes like a bland waffle. this could very well be the best protein in the world (thus the 2-star rating), but in my opinion the flavor and the delivery are both very important factors of a good supplement. this product dropped the ball in both."

wrong item. i received the wrong item. i received tea. how do i get the correct item.
listen to the reviews!. my item also arrived expired.
"ridiculous. package arrived broken and seemed to be taped back close after someone opened it, just horrible packaging!"
"weird chewy. so these are not hard gummies but rather chewy (sticky) ones. they do taste good with no weird aftertaste. they also last 75 days which is a strange amount since its 2.5 months, but it is a great value. i like that you don't have to worry about wheat, gluten, dairy, soy or egg allergies since it doesn't contain any of those. i probably wouldn't buy again because i like gummies that are a little harder but if you have chewing issues, these might be for you."

"pills extremely cracked and flakey. looks like the quality of these has gone down, or i received a bad batch.after just a week or so after opening, the pills became extremely cracked and flakey, despite the expiration of a year from now. they we're also dtored sealed in a cool cabinet with all other pills and meds, so that wasn't the cause.hoping their quality improves, but i'd avoid buying these until it does."

"formula has changed. i’ve been purchasing this product in the chocolate and vanilla flavors for a couple of years. i really liked that it provided 2 servings of vegetables and digestive enzymes in addition to the protein. it had a bit of a gritty texture (i blend with a banana and 1 c of unsweetened coconut milk), but the flavor was good so i didn’t mind. i’ve even recommended it to others. however, the formula has changed. the ingredients are similar, but different amounts. it is also much sweeter now, and leaves an awful aftertaste (from the change or increase in sweetener, i assume). the texture is much creamier, but the sweetness and aftertaste made me so nauseous i can’t drink it. hopefully i can return it — only took one use to know it was a no go for me. anyway, just wanted to point out that it’s a new formula because i didn’t see or know that before repurchasing. so disappointing."

these may be right for some - but totally ineffective for me!. i liked the taste.that's all!
"expires too soon. they expire less than 6 months from when we got them. we'll never use 500 ibuprofen in 6 months. it costs $5.99 to return them, so we're stuck with the purchase"

"only work half the time. these were okay. kind of hit or miss with me. i’ve never had trouble sleeping... but ever since i had knee surgery, i’ve had many nights where i have trouble sleeping. not sure if there’s any correlation there, but that’s the only thing that has changed in my life... so i figured these might help.unfortunately, they only worked some nights. i was taking 2 - chewing thoroughly and washing down with a glass of water. it was kind of weird that they only worked some nights and not every time i took them. they were either great and knocked me out, or they were the complete opposite and totally ineffective. i looked for reasons/patterns (diet/exercise/etc), but i couldn’t come up with a reason as to why they were hit or miss. guess i’ll have to try something else."

do not buy if you have anxiety!!!. please do not buy these if you have depression and anxiety they made my anxiety way worse and i found myself crying daily when i would take these.
beware of allergen ingredients!. there is something causing an allergic reaction. i began to sneeze and itch quite often! and i’m not allergic to anything. beware!
not effective. doesn't really work.
gross!!!. it arrived with the inside of the bottle and all the pills covered in yellow curcumin goo that had seeped out the pills somehow. the contents smelled horrible!! threw them away!!!

"kids don’t like the taste.. both of my children disliked the taste and consistency. once it becomes a fight, back they go."
"noooooooooo. please don’t take this. learn from the horror stories in the comments and runnfast and far away from this level of biotin. the acne comes fast and even if you have never had bad acne...you will get it and the scars are long lasting and possibly lifelong for those that get cystic acne 😔look for other things for your hair/nails that doesn’t cause such horrible side effects. if you desperately love and want to have almost instant acne, this is definitely what you’re looking for!"

"stay away....you've been warned!!!. this product is horrible!!! both me and my wife had very painful stomach aches and pains as well as diarrhea for days after taking this!!! even after i stopped taking it, my diarrhea still lasted for almost a week later!!! read the reviews about what this product does and believe them!!! the suffering you get from using this product is not worth the benefits!!!"
not very coffee flavored. this is way more chocolate than coffee but a far better price than my previous protein coffe. not pleased with the taste but for the savings i'll make do... maybe mix it with the more pricey stuff.
"made me really sick. i was so happy to find this product so i could have the sugar taste without the carbs. after all my research, i came to the conclusion that erythritol is the safest. i used this product for pancakes and got super sick to my stomach. the worst flavor coming back up that i have ever experienced in my life. i didn't even think twice about throwing the rest out."

"2 units have broken--wiring issue. i loved this diffuser at first, but i've had 2 units now and both have broken in the same way: the buttons on the front have either stopped working or changed functions. it's totally bizarre. one day the power button turns on the diffuser, the next day it doesn't do anything. one day the light button works, the next day it turns the sound on instead and the sound button doesn't work. there's some sort of wiring issue going on here. i am very upset that i missed the return window on this 2nd unit. now i am stuck with a useless hunk of plastic that cost me $40."

"hard to swallow. i would love these if they came in capsule form.  as a tablet they are huge and difficult to swallow.  i usually do not have trouble swallowing pills, but with these, i do"
haven’t received product yet. it’s saturday my order was supposed to be here thursday haven’t received it yet
horse pills.. a half dozen each day. there has to be a more efficient way to get the same supplemental dosage.
"not my fav. i typically don’t buy vanilla flavored protein because i usually don’t like it. this stuff had great reviews so i took a gamble. i hate it. the smell. the taste. just terrible. i’m going to try sprucing it up with some pb2, i’m sure that will help."
"shards in drink. i’m conflicted because on one hand i’ve been drinking these beverages for a while now and they’re good and get the job done. that being said, i noticed this one tasting weird and poured it out to see what is pictured. i’m unsure what it is but is was off putting and i’m sure it’s not supposed to look like that."

product was not very good. they were stuck together in one big ball and seemed  old and stalebut thet were tasty
"good idea, didnt work for us. texture and taste good. do not have some of the vitamins, etc i wanted"
"second batch is not cleaning well. i’m on my second box of solimo but something is different with this batch.  it’s not cleaning our dishes-  they come out smelling bad and in some cases, with a food residue.  i’ve not experienced this in the past but after trying another detergent brand, the issues went away.  too bad- my first box of solimo worked great and i thought i’d found a winner!"
"it doesn't really help. for me, this product didn't help at all.  i used it for six months and got no relief from my symptoms.  most medical evidence says that the benefit, if any, from this herbal is psychological. i didn't experience any benefit from the placebo effect either so i finally threw in the towel.. my doctor gave me and rx for a prostate medicine and it worked overnight, ending six months of misery.  if the herbal works for you - great.  but if it doesn't, don't suffer to long -  go see a doctor."
"absolutely terrible. first off all the bags i received were defective. the string that is used to tie the bag was broken, so i had to manually tie it. the strength of the bag was a joke. if you put anything even remotely heavy, (like an empty wine bottle) it tears. i will be trying to return these, and have gone back to hefty for my trash bags, at least they have better quality control. these bags are not worth the few dollars i saved. i will not be ordering these again."
"not sure that absorption is good.. i've taken many b complexes and this one does not have the potency the others do, even given the supposed same quantity.  i wouldn't recommend this as a value."
doesn't help with bv. i have been using for almost a week and nothing has happened so far. i've had bv for 2 months now and have been to the doctor countless times and i was wanting ti take a break from all the antibiotics.

jar opened. first thing i noticed was the oil spots in the mailing box.  then i felt the oil around the jar lid. lid was loose. top seal was broken.  had to throw it out.  will not order again.  don't know where it went wrong but not taking a chance with a product i intend to consume.  i'll just go to a local store.

buy elsewhere. if your bottle arrives broken and all over the box you have to jump through too many hoops and lose about 6 hours of wages to return the item. buy from walmart at least they pack it so it doesn't arrive broken. poor bottle material that can't ship inside a box with hardback books and garden hoses with no packaging.
"sugar around the gummy. this one come with sugar around the gummy and i personally don’t like it,just extra sugar,taste ok but not as good as the original vita gummy one."
"heed the warning on the bottle!!. most of my vitamins and supplements are from now foods. this company is approved by my integrative health physician and you get great quality at a fair price.i hate liquid medicine but after reading the benefits of psyllium powder vs capsules, i tried to get over myself. the directions call for 1 tblsp. some research suggested starting off with 1/2 that or even a teaspoon and working up to the whole tablespoon.i started with 1 tsp in room temperature water, mixing well. it's not that it has a bad or medicinal taste but it does smell and feel like you're drinking sand water. my stomach revolted and i almost didn't get it down. the next morning, i thought i'd bypass making a drink and throw back the powder followed by water as the chaser. big mistake! do not try this at home! as soon as the powder hits your tongue/back of throat, it starts expanding. the water just turns it into cement. i swallowed what i could and went straight to brush and floss. even after more than 4 brushes and as many flosses, it was still stuck in my teeth. i was working it out the rest of the day. day 3, i went back to mixing it but literally gagged and threw it out. end of experiment. if i try psyllium again, i'll take the coward's way out and get capsules."

beware of bubble guts. this product has given me the most insane bubble guts i have ever had. i tried it for the first time two days ago and i have been suffering ever since. i know that this reaction is probably rare but just want you to know it happens. i had to call out sick from work and haven’t been able to stray too far from my restroom
will not buy again!!!. taste okay didn't notice difference
delivery sucked. absolutely disgusted by the delivery! it was delivered after 9 pm and it was in a garbage bag hanging from my mailbox. if i wasn’t checking the tracking all day it would have been out there overnight. that is if it wasn’t stolen! my mailbox is right next to street. tracking states it was delivered at my porch. it was not!

low dose aspirin... haven't received it as of 6/1/19..
"i did not like the result.. i was hoping that it will work as a meal replacement to me because i'm trying to cut some calories from my daily intake but this didnt help. i was expecting to not get hungry for atleast 4 hours after drinking this but just after 1 hour i get hungry again & feel weak. it didnt boost my energy. i've been drinking it for 4 days now & i didnt like the result so im giving it to my husband. i will buy another brand of protein shake. the taste is fine with me. i dont mind the gritty texture. i only tried it with almond milk but not with water. my husband tried it with water & he was like ""brrrr"".. i guess he didnt like how it taste. but i will suggest him to drink it with almond milk."
"quality control concerns. the bottle came with the bottom of the glass completely broken off and not in the package. the broken bottle was wrapped in bubble wrap. i used to like this product, but if they are packaging broken bottles then i cannot trust the quality and safety of this product. i will never purchase items from this company again."
nothing different. nature's bounty evenbeauty beauty multivitamins.well pills are all gone and i did not notice any changes good or bad with this one.i do  like the size of these pills which made them easy for me to take.seem safe enough and good ingredients.nothing seems different to me one way or the other so that is just ok nothing great.might work better for someone else. maybe i am too far gone in life and a lost cause with anything helping.i still like to try things out to see if can really ever find something to improve  my skin from the inside out.

always smells like spoiled milk. it does give you a protein fix but i don't care for the flavor and for some reason it always smells like spoiled milk when i mix it. i understand this comes from dairy but i've had other dairy based protein powders that didn't smell spoiled. i'm actually going to try some plant based protein powders when this jug is done as i am trying to maove away from consuming animal products and incorporate a more natural based diet.
nearly expired chocolates!. why is my food item expiring june 19?  the food item is not fresh and the quality below my expectations.  you shouldn't be selling nearly expired food items for above cotsco price
broken glass bottle. the bottle came broken with the shards of glass mixed in the tablets.
taste. tastes terrible
leaked. i just received my order and it leaked everywhere!!!!!!!  this is not good!
terrible packaging. the packaging was horrific! this did not happen in transportation. it looks like someone opened the box to look at the product and did not care how they taped the box back.
did nothing for me.. after using a bottle of this product i cannot say it lived up to its claims.
"tried for awhile, makes things worse.. does not work...makes hair dry and increases flakes. itchy scalp gets worse."
"disappointed. did not receive this item 81%aspirin,  2nd time this month did not get a item"
tastes horrible. this tastes absolutely horrible! the fake sweetener was all you tasted.
wanted to like it. i like other vega products but this flavor is gross. returned it.
"broken bottle. this is how i just received my order. it was very poorly wrapped, the box is soaked in oil and the bottom of the bottle is completely broken off. i started the replacement process. i hope i don’t get charged for it."
didn’t work for me. didn’t help e at all. wouldn’t buy again.
horrible taste. taste terrible!
"can’t stand the pungent odor. this maybe a good product but has very pungent odour. organic, natural, bla, bla may all good but going through the torture once every day is no good."
not worth the money. didn't work
not worth the money. didn't work
ick. horrible after taste
"smells very fishy. the softgels were great for the first couple months. then recently, i've been smelling very very fishy smell whenever i open the container. my pill smells very fishy as well.i bought this product because it said there will be no fishy smell and i'm very disappointed."
"overpriced here on ""x brand"". the price is abt 13$ more than the store price. if you dont mind that then go ahead and buy here on ""x brand"". i returned it"
great value. i thought these were supposed to make my husband smart. they didn't work. lol
"itchy. i don't have any known allergies, but this product made me extremely itchy (especially in the hands and feet). also made me extremely sleepy for the few days i took it."
"refunded. not sure if item was stolen, but lost in transit. after no item in one month, company refunded my money. pleased with that! not sure how to rate so went 50/50. glad to get refund."
"very disappointed  in now -caused bump on gum, trip to dentist- 4th bottle no weight loss!!!. do not buy!!"
made me feel sick. i got this product because i love the garden of life brand in general. i took this and about 20 mins after drinking it i felt so sick. i got really bad stomach cramping and diarrhea. i thought it was from my salad i had at lunch. tried it again 2 days later and it did the same thing. thank god for activated charcoal to help calm my painful stomach. i’m sure other people’s systems can handle it but mine couldn’t.

"has corn products in the ingredients... not good for people with corn allergies.. it's just not made with clean ingredients. even though i haven't opened my package (not even the plastic on the outside of the bottle), they won't let me return it. a waste. i have a corn allergy... i didn't notice corn starch and malodextrin in the ingredients. not a clean product... i usually buy clean but thought 'calcium is calcium' and thought nature made would have more natural products. wrong. it has the worst additives in it. i wish they'd let me return it."

never truth in this vendor. never buy againeven i return the item and never received my money back.
one bottle was broken. the product is great and having been buying from my mom for few years now. this time i ordered 5 bottles and the packing was very bad with the result one bottle was broken . i did not open the package a few weeks after because i was taking it overseas and did not contact the seller for the replacement

"very insignificant amount of ala. i felt the moral obligation to write this review to let unsuspecting buyers know that while ala is certainly healthy, you need a much higher amount than you'll get from this product if you're looking for a vegan alternative to fish oil, unless you're taking about 15 capsules per day. the nih says the conversion rate for ala to epa and dha is between 5% and 10%: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9637947. usually, 500mg of epa and dha is the recommended minimum, so a 5% conversion from ala would mean you need to consume 10 grams of ala for a proper conversion to replace fish oil.personally i would recommend just buying ground flaxseed and adding that to your food. you'd save money over buying this supplement. and for the linoleic acid and oleic acid content of this supplement, these are just common polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat. you would get a higher dose from eating a single peanut."
"too larhe to swallow. i concur with other reviewer’s who have said this pill is way too large. it is probably excellent glucosamine, but it is so big it does not even fit in my pill cutter!  i had a scary moment the other morning when i actually choked on one of these and thought i was going to have to give myself the heimlich maneuver. regrettably, i will have to find another brand."
"who drinks this stuff?. i weigh 145lbs and wanted to try to gain some weight, but this stuff is absolutely horrible. it tastes disgusting (think 1 part chalky milkshake and 1 part sugar) and is next to impossible to drink. i ended up throwing this stuff away because it was absolutely vile."
delivered to wrong address. delivered to wrong address. haven’t received it yet 😡
"these. taste. nauseating.. they work as well as other melatonin, but the taste is absolutely repulsive. and the aftertaste is even worse. hard pass."

"dry like cardboard. the bars were very dry and flaky, like old stale bars.  never purchasing again"
"just go to costco and get it yourself.. i rarely write reviews because i’m just plain not good at it but i felt i needed to write one for the most recent delivery of an ""x brand"" order.the pictures tell the story really. the packaging was extremely poor and a couple of bottles didn’t make it. i received this order at work and had to repack it just to get it home.i added the photo of the label because i work for ups and it irritates me that an ""x brand"" shipper would actually put a weight of one pound on a package that actually weighs 49 pounds. rest assured, i’ll make sure they’re billed correctly.and to make matters worse, this took way more than 2 days to get to me. better off just stopping at costco and getting it myself.  lesson learned."

"weird texture & color but filling. i started having a scoop with my lunch every day because normally i start getting really hungry around 4pm and this definitely helps me make it to dinner time. i've tried various non-dairy milks and water but it never really dissolves and has a very gritty texture. it also has a kind of sickening greenish brown color. if you can ignore the texture, the flavor is pretty nice. i might try something new like mixing it into oatmeal or chia pudding or something."

wrong item. like others i recieved regular cinnamon
i didn’t see any changes. well i completely finished two bottles of this product and i didn’t saw any changes or improvements in any of the departments this product advertised.save your coins
pills. disgusting
not worth the proce. tastes horrible.
"i'm just not thrilled with the scent. in general, i like solimo products, and i appreciate that they're so affordable. but i just don't like the scent of this one. i much prefer the solimo cleansers with colloidal oatmeal. the label says ""fragrance"", so i don't know what they're using, but to me it smells somewhat medicinal. i'm not criticizing the effectiveness of this cleanser, which contains glycerin, castor oil, and other ingredients normally found in moisturizing cleansers. but this is not for me; i'll stick to the solimo colloidal oatmeal, which i find much more agreeable."

the expiration date is too soon.. the expiration date is too soon. you must take two tablet day: around 6 months. and it expire in august. i ordered 3 of those.
"weird texture. i really don't mind the flavor of these. the texture however...it reminds me of those circus peanut candies. yuck. also, they leave my mouth orange."

yuck!. i did not like this at all!  the taste was kind of bland with a slight vanilla flavor and very chalky!  it may be fine served cold and blended into a shake with other ingredients but i wouldn't recommend it on its own.
"melatonin 5mg. flavor was awful, price decent,sleep amazingly quick"
"not what i ordered. what i got is not what was advertised, why?returning"
has this ever happened to you?. most of the pills were broken in half! and it is a big deal to me. has this ever happened to you after ordering this product? i wonder if the transport has something to do with it perhaps? it comes packaged with cotton inside to prevent this unless it was packaged this way. not very pleased with it at all. i won't be ordering from this brand anymore.
"didn’t receive the item. ordered and somehow the order was lost. never received the item. ""x brand"" kindly refunded."
"no results. i decided to start taking these as my nails are weak and break often. unfortunately i haven't noticed any change after weeks of taking this biotin. i will continue to try it, but so far have seen no results."
"tart. not a bad product, a bit hard to get used too."
"tart. not a bad product, a bit hard to get used too."
"strawberry taste terrible. the title says it all.  this product mixes well, and my stomach tolerates it just fine.  the major issue is that it not only has the ""sucralose"" aftertaste, but i have to just slam this just to drink it.  i was excited to use strawberry for smoothies, but i just can't sip on this.  unfortunate that i bought the 4.6lbs first.  lesson learned."
how big do you want it?. too expensive walmart sells it for less
too much sugar. i don't like them. there is a lot of sugar in them. i'm going back to the brand that i like. the price was less but not the best value for me.

"expiration was 4 months in the future. what's the use of 365 one-a-day tablets if they expire in 120 days? now, sure – drug expirations are not necessarily real, but the reason why i bought these was because my previous bottle was expiring. now i'm just going to have more expired allergy drugs before the season's over."

"gave me a head rash. for months.. so i dont know about buying this online. ive been taking this product for about 2 years now and i love it, but in the past i bought it at cvs. when i saw this sale i was extremely excited for the price value because youre basically getting buy one get one free..that should have been my first warning. the taste was off but i thought nothing of it because the taste was a little harsh to begin with. then i started getting a head rash. i thought it was from other products so i changed everything back to what i knew wouldnt cause it and for months i still had it. i had gotten another shipment of these from ""x brand"" because i never in the past had that happen from these pills and i didnt think it was from them at the time, but i still had a rash and had no idea where it was coming from. i finally decided to stop taking this to see what would happen since it was the only supplement i was taking. and what do you know? a week after i stopped taking the pills my rash was gone. completely. i dont know if someone switched these pills or if they are sold so cheaply because they are actually expired, all i know is that when i bought then in store the previous two years this never happened. so that sucked and now i have two bottles i have to throw away."
"easy to chew. i found these stress gummies easy to chew.  they have a light citrus-berry flavor that is pleasant.  the package calls for taking 2 gummies per day as needed.  the label states the goods inside are gaba, l-theanine, and lemon balm all of which are supposed to aid in stress and stress relief.  i personally didn’t see any difference in my stress levels - the label says the gaba works in 30-60 minutes.  perhaps maybe with continued usage it would be possible to see a change.  also, the zipper seal on my package does not work after opening the bag of chews."

"uhhh.... the orange flavor was pleasant and not overwhelming as some other reviews had mentioned. the gummies were sticky, but i am not sure if that is due to the delivery circumstances, i have never tried these before. the three stars are not for the product itself, but for the condition of it upon arrival. my package was handed directly to me by the driver and i let it cool for several hours before opening. the gummies were semi-stuck together and the bottom of the bottle was bowed, i presume from the heat. i will be returning to ""x brand"". i do not recommend purchasing in summer if you live in the desert southwest. i must admit that now i am concerned about the health and safety of their drivers, given the condition of the bottle and contents upon receiving."

lost?. well after almost three weeks i decided to request a refund.  never received it.  can't say if they are good or not.  i am considering cancelling my prime subscription. shipment to puerto rico is terrible.  takes almost 2 weeks to receive any product and mostly because it does not shipped immediately.
vitamins. wasn’t a fan of these the taste is awful leaves a funny after taste
0. taste gross
"manufacturer lies. first off they changed the formula, adding an artificial sweetener that leaves a horrid aftertaste and causes me headaches …..worst yet !!!! .... is the copy paste response being slapped on every review that denies the change in formula to discredit their very own customers to protect their sales .... (no i'm not confusing flavors)but they say they listen to their customers, unless they dislike what they're saying, at which point they call them liars"

won’t buy again. these aren’t anything for people up in age to take don’t seem to work as well as my other vitamins.... glad they were cheap
"bad dreams. i really wanted this to work, but it didn't work well for me.  it did put me to sleep but i had bad, crazy dreams and woke up several times, about every 1 1/2 hours.  also, i felt drugged.  these effects lasted about 7 hours. therefore, apparently the time-release feature did work.  i understand melatonin, different brands, and different doses, work differently for different people."

still didn't receive my product. today is 4/22 and i have still not received my product :(
warning. when i opened the bottle there was a strong chemical smell.  i poured them in a different container thinking it was the packaging and tried one.  i got a really bad headache that would not go away for hours.

"shattered bottle. horrible, horrible! just opened up my box of vitamins that i have a subscription for and glass everywhere inside the box of vitamins. shattered glass pcs. inside the vitamins and bottle in broken apart. there was dirt and other foreign dust particles all over the inside of the ""x brand"" packaging. why is there dirt in the shipping package and how could you send this product like this to a customer? returning"
yuck!. these taste terrible.  there were mixed other vitamins in with my prenatals.
gave me horrible diarrhea. i mixed the powder in water thoroughly as directed.  it gave me terrible diarrhea.  i wasn’t 100% positive that it was the product rather than a bug or something i ate so i gave it a second try.  diarrhea & gi upset for 4 days!
"it's ok. i would give this a straight up 5 star rating, but it gets docked a few stars. first off, i did order the vanilla and received chocolate. there's one little bitty sticker that says the flavor, and i did not find it until after i mixed the first glass, wondering with the most confused look as to how vanilla anything was mixing brown. the taste is okay. you can get used to it, and you might even learn to like it. i dock it another star because it doesn't mix as well as claimed in the description and online. if you're using a high speed blender, 100% perfect. spoon mixing, and sometimes shaking, not so much. overall, i'd say pretty good. especially being you can buy a huge tub and not have to worry about it for a minute."

do not purchase. both levels of cookies were melted and stuck together. many were broken. taste was nothing special. grocery store cookies are better and fresher. don't waste your money.

"much less potent than it used but still charging the same price. many of their products used to be made using a process they described as ""hypercritical"".they came in softgels and were in a liquid form.zyflamed used to be made this way as well as their holy basil force product and many others.those formulations were so potent that the smell of them would fill the room when you took the cap off.now all of their products are made as a paste or powder.apparently proctor and gamble bought them several years ago but the founders of the company continued running things until just last year.the founders made an announcement that proctor and gamble was compromising the quality of the new chapter products in pursuit of higher profits and they could no longer work alongside them in good conscious, how sad.is the quality of this product still reliable? i don't know and thats the problem. i trust the founders of new chapter when they say the p&g is compromising on quality and i can see for myself that it isn't as potent as it used to be. that doesn't mean that its not any good at all of course but unless a trustworthy independent lab tests the product i have no way of knowing how good or not good it is.i certainly do not trust p&g or any claims they might make on their word alone.garden of life recently sold out as well, and for that brand the news is even worse as they were bought by nestle.i will try and find alternatives for the new chapter products i used to use. apparently the founders of new chapter are in the process of starting a new company.these people who own organic/sustainable food or supplement companies are deluding themselves if they think they can sell to these huge multinational brands with long histories of crimes against humanity and the earth and expect that those same brands will continue to operate their companies with the same standards and ethics that they had.i guess it is easy to fool yourself into believing whatever you want to believe when someone is waving hundreds of millions of dollars in your face.all that being said the herbs in this are wonderful medicinal plants and i encourage you to try using them.if you don’t want to take the time find other sources for each individual herb this formulation might still be your best bet.i no longer take this product but instead takeseveral of these herbs individually from companies that i have more trust in.turmeric in particular is better taken as 95%+ curcumin extract along with bioperine or taken as a specialty formulated highly bioavilable form.the two best forms are longvida and theracumin."

"know what you're buying. i've only used these when coming away from other supplements to give the body a better chance to adjust. i can't say if they work at all. if you're looking to have some sort of performance boost, don't expect too much or any at all. consider that these cost a tenth of some of the more vouched for products. that being said, the ingredient contents are similar to a lot of other stuff on here. if you're considering one of the other brands on here that cost 40 or 50 dollars, you might as well use this. those are just as inferior to the higher end tbs as these. these all have ingredients that have the capability, but no test results that definitively prove the products themselves show an increase. even if you only put on 5 or 10 lbs in a month, consider that your money's worth. also, keep in mind that these are big pills that have a bad smell and taste. the other brands on here are going to be similar, so again, if you're going to try a cheap product, it might as well be this. at least the brand itself is a notable one in the supplements industry."

"contains toxic fragrance. if i had realized this contained fragrance i would have never ordered it.  in all the years i've been buying anti-itch creams, sprays, ointments, etc. i've never had one with fragrance.  when the skin is already inflamed, one doesn't need to add an irritant like fragrance to a product that is supposed to soothe & protect.  i'm so disappointed.  this time of year is poison ivy/oak season due to how much we are all out & about all over our farm.  we do our best to avoid & destroy the poison ivy/oak but sometimes, you just don't realize you've touched it or you know you have, but didn't wash up soon enough or thoroughly enough & joy to the world, another oozing, itching, blistery rash to make you insane.  anyway, this goes in the trash.  thankfully i have a cabinet full of various other brands (generic & name) to help us deal with the itchy season."

very tiny - need to take 6 of these. i didn’t realize i would need to take 6 of these little guys at a time. the larger vitamin was only 2. nothing wrong with product but need to move fast in am so the least amount of time to take vitamins the better.
"no scoop inside and it is unbearable by itself. no scoop inside :(.... i also bought glutamine and there was no scoop inside of that as well. by the way, unless youre used to using unflavored bcaas and adding it to juice, do not buy unflavored. it its atrociously bad tasting (unlike glutamine, which can be drank in water by itself with ease) in just water."

great flavor mislabeled. the cookies and cream come in a 4.65 lb container. when checking out the option selected was 5lb also the container in the image shows a 5lb container. i have ordered other flavors and they came in a 5lb container. it just seemed odd that the cookies and cream was short by over 1/3 of a lb than expected. will not be buying this flavor because the is equates to over 10 servings lost which increases the net cost per serving.the cookies and cream does taste very good especially when shaken with milk and poured over cereal.

"funky taste. i got a generic brand before these from cvs, and was wondering if this price would make a difference. so they are pink lemonade, but it's almost too sweet for me and tastes like a stevia or sweetener (which, i'm not supposed to go near when pregnant). also, the standard flavor in the bottle vice mixed flavors kinds of bugs me a bit, and i almost wince when i go to eat these. i don't think i'll be getting these again for the flavor alone."

wet wipes are dry. these wet wipes are not wet barely could call them most definitely the dryest wet wipe i have used witch makes them pretty much useless
"broken pills. the product came damaged, many of the pills were broken in half and crushed."
"d-mannose is a lifesaver! the two stars is for how i received this open.. d manose is truly a life saver. i suffered with bladder infections for 10 years, i found this and i never have them and if i feel them coming on this gets rid of it.  i gave this review two stars simply because of how i received my package. when i opened it the paper seal inside was broken. that concerned me so i started looking, you can see where someone pryed the purple plastic ring that you tear off, off of the bottle without having to tear the security seal off. this made me super paranoid, especially because the powder didn’t taste like d-manose at all. not sure what happened but i will be returning this and going to a whole foods store to purchase it now."
"wrong flavor.  again!!!. i like the price and i like the product.  but twice in a row they have sent me vanilla when i requested chocolate.  you would thing that after i keep sending it back, they would get it.  the vanilla is fine, but i have five containers and am out of chocolate.  c'mon man."
not effective for me. i didnt notice any difference in the way i felt.
"expired item. i have just received the item about to expired 5/2019. why are stilled send item that do to expired within a few days.  as a customer, i am not happy about. this is not the first complaint from the customer and it not acceptable."
disappointing. i normally buy now and its usually good. i bought this lavender and it smells funny. i do not like it at all. i was disappointed in this.
"somethings changed: not the same as before. upon the recommendation of my doctor, i've taken b6 50 mg twice a day for more than 30 years. i used to take twinlabs before they discontinued the 50mg. i switched to whole foods about 10 years ago. worked great. with my most recent purchase (march 2019) i noticed, while the label still said 50 mg, the pills were much smaller. after a week of taking the new stuff it does not have the same results as the old formula. something has changed. whatever they did, the new version does not work. save your money and buy a reputable brand -- which i am now scrambling to find."

"bitter. chemical-y. etc.... all i taste is chemicals and alcohol (and yes, hazelnut, but the rest of the profile is overwhelming)... it is bitter to me, not sweet. it also made my tongue numb, so i think i'm allergic. i really wish i could return this."

"didn't see any difference.. these tasted like candy, which made them easy to take, however i did not notice a difference in my hair, skin or nails."
"didn’t have much scent. very happy with another now oil (clove), but this one didn’t have much scent even if you stuck your nose into the bottle. i simmered it on the stove, but really no scent. i was disappointed."

"looks can be decieving.. looks sturdy compared.to the current hefty brands i'm using. however, i noticed leaking. didn't think it was the bags but kids tossing stuff into the garbage but not in the bag. picking up wet things on the deck, i noticed the bag leaking.  so they look sturdy but they leak. so no wet kitchen garbage in the kitchen garbage bag. bad batch?"

too sugary. too sweet tastes like candy
gave me a horrible allergic reaction. i got a terrible and very painful rash on the first day i took it
"rancid product. i don't know if this is returnable at this point but it smells terrible and i don't want to risk taking it. i haven't had this problem before, but more likely an ""x brand"" issue than the product brand."
poor. makes me crash very hard
"gave me a headache every time i took it.. i hate to give a bad review, but these d3 vitamins gave me an awful headache every time i took them. i don’t get headaches - unless it’s the morning after too many glasses of wine, but that’s different ;). i still gave them 3 stars because i can see in the reviews that they’ve worked well for others! everyone’s body chemistry is unique so while these might be great for one person, they weren’t so much for me."

"not flavor pictured. disappointed and not happy, ordered back in jan and loved the cherry flavor, my child took them with ease. i ordered this again because we like the cherry flavor and when delivered we received the berry flavor! the picture shows cherry and there is no option to choose a flavor."
good price but a waste.. these wipes are okay but not as good as huggies. they are thin and not very wet. unfortunately these didn’t work out for us. :(

"this stuff is nasty. the ""good before"" date said 2020.. yuk... this stuff tasted rancid the minute i cracked the seal....got my money back and threw away....got ""california olive ranch"" brand and its the bomb and all the reviews say so, too..one of the top rated brands and comes in a glass bottle..not plastic, unless you order the largest one..go for the smaller in the glass bottle. it tastes waaaaaay better than anything in plastic.."
good if you do not want them salted. better than other products like this one  felt over priced
grainy bad taste. i put this in a blender. it would not blend well. tasted like dirt floating in water. not very palatable.

"not very large peanuts!. i was expecting the huge virginia peanuts, but this is a mixture of large and small.  they taste pretty good and are fairly crisp. i will look for the real virginia peanuts next time, which are all huge!"

"do not buy. these diapers fall apart.. these are the absolute worst diapers!! this was my first order of these diapers in a size 5 and already six of the diapers have broke. by broke, i mean that the diapers just fell apart and the little material inside of the diaper that absorbs liquids just spilled out of the diaper, smeared all over my son, and got all on the floor/bed. if this happened once or twice then i would have ignored it and said that i just got a defective batch. but this has happened six times. i change my sons diaper fairly frequently and each time this has happened, there was only a little bit in his diaper. i will never buy these diapers ever again and will tell everyone i know with children and prime accounts to stay away."
mislabeled flavors or just bad?. i normally buy sweet leaf stevia drops in the vanilla flavor but thought i would change up brands to see what was out there. on first open the vanilla smelled strongly of coconut and unfortunately tasted of coconut too. very disappointing.

it may help. i used this for a while and i think it suppress my appetite somehow. if you choose to eat healthy and move a bit more you may lose weight but i have not lost any weight.
not happy. smells very bad not like jasmine. not work my money

terrible taste. i couldn’t tolerate the taste.
"beware, can majorly accelerate hair loss. monitor use if concerned. my review is more regarding creatine in general rather the optimum brand- which makes great suppliments.i bought this about a month after starting rogaine so my hair was already thinning. my hair quickly started rapidly thinning...i know this by frequently cleaning hair clogging my shower drain, which had never happened before. i read rogaine causes hair shedding in the beginning and i assumed it was from that. after like 4 months of still rapidly loosing hair i made an appt with a hair loss specialist. from her, i realized creatine might had been the cause so i stopped using it. my hair loss rapidly slowed and i’m not cleaning the drain anymore. apparently all the hair you lose due to creatine will grow back once you stop, so fingers crossed that’s my case.  since for me hair is more important than muscles, i won’t be using creatine ever again. i’m aware other people might not feel the same or won’t have the same side effect as me. i just wanted anyone to know that if you do take it, be aware you could lose hair and monitor that"
"unnecessary addition to diet.. this product has not changed the look or texture of my hair, skin, or nails since i started using it months ago."
"flavor is terrible.. the flavor of the gummies is terrible to say the least.  ordered because a friend swears by them.  used the entire bottle despite the taste but did not see any benefit.  perhaps it takes more than a month to realize any benefit, or perhaps the benefit is unmeasurable, however i will not be repurchasing."
too big. this product is giant! i am fine with big pills to swallow but this one makes me give up to take it. i didn’t get why it was made so big. there is no flavor though

nasty. they taste awful and have more of a chalky consistency than normal gummies.
hugely disappointed in this. didn't get rid of my infection didn't do it in a day either. mckessons antifungal cream is the way to go
"yikes, hard pass. disgusting, very disgusting.  the outer part is actually not half bad, but the filling ruins the whole thing. this is just my personal preference but yuck. totally regret getting these, don't even wanna try another flavor."

"gave me heartburn/gerd. i'm going back to animal pak after the intense days long heartburn/gerd this gave me when i was on it.  i couldn't for the life of me figure out what was causing it but once i finally stopped this multivitamin it went away.  i had gerd symptoms for over a month.  animal pak or on's optimen, neither gave me issues with digestion like this did."
wasting money. didn’t work at all wasting g of money
i won’t buy again it taste like sugar alcohol. the taste is horrible it doesn’t taste like peanut butter at all it just taste like artificial sweetener sugar alcohols

"after a month, started smelling terrible!!!. i purchased these multivitamins because they seemed like a cheap, but well-reviewed brand. the first few days were fine, the pills are not too big, but after a few weeks i started to notice a smell. it got stronger and stronger, but i wasn't sure what it smelled like, only that it smelled terrible. then i realized, it smells like dog piss...i am currently in the process of returning these now. maybe i just got a bad batch. all i know is that i cannot take them anymore."

"tastes awful!. i love gummy vitamins, and 99% of them taste good. but these taste so gross, i need a chaser w them. ever had a chitlin? tastes worse."
waaaaayyyy tooo sweet. oh my god it is so sweet it's gross. was hoping for that more cacao-chocolaty type of taste but it shocked me how sweet it was. i literally only use it in overnight oats recipes because i can protein boost them really hard without having to add any flavor to plain ass oats and plain ass greek yogurt because this stuff is so strong. for a smoothie or anything else? too strong for me.

bad tast. has a bad bad tast it feels so grainy and doesn’t give much energy after drinking i use two scoops so it doesn’t make sence

yuck!. soooooo gross!!! nothing like advocare fruit punch! love the grape though!
broken lid. mine arrived with a broken lid? thought the missing piece would be in the box but it's not there. pretty bummed about this purchase.
these are horrible. these shakes taste horrible. i opened one bottle and took a couple sips and gagged. it is chalky tasting with some other offensive flavor not sure what it is but they are nasty
"didn't notice any improvements. eh, didn't really do what i was hoping regarding focus, concentration and motivation. i didn't notice any effects at all until i doubled the recommended dose, and then i only noticed my dreams became a lot more vivid. but still no noticeable improvements during the work day."
wrong flavor. if you look at my order it was for chocolate...you sent vanilla.  i don't want to go thru the bother of sending back so will keep it....but not happy.  if you would send another chocolate one i will write a good review....thanks!!
fast delivery but wrong flavor. going to give this flavor a try even though i ordered the cherry flavor. wish i would’ve gotten what i asked for. the hassle of returning is annoying.

does good. tastes bad.. this stuff taste horrible. we got the watermelon before and it was great. we like grape.... but this is so overly flavored it makes it taste horrible. we still chug our way through it because it does it’s job.

"found it's not effective as chromium picolinate .. i didn't get good results from this chromium for my needs. i have used the gtf in the past, but a different brand that was a bit more effective . i cant recall which one it was.  it was  in the 90's. i have tried the swanson chromium picolinate brand very effective to help with balancing blood sugar levels , appetite control & sugar cravings along with eating lower carbs. i will stick with swanson's."

"""x brand"" you have a problem!. this isn't really about the quality of the product.  it's about the eternal problem with search engines and what the ""x brand"" website brings up.  i searched under hydrolized guar gum, for medicinal purposes.  and, oops, i didn't notice that what came up was guar gum for cooking, two vastly different things!  and now i learn that i can't return the wrong product.  the only good news is this product didn't cost much."
vitamin. made super sick
nope nope nope. absolutely despised these vitamins. i wanted to like them... loved the smells (hard to do first trimester lol) but the taste/ gritty sugar coating is abhorrent. made my morning sickness about 10x worse and lasted for hours.

get something else. i don't even care how it tastes at this point. the box was damaged and poorly packed. two cans soaked the entire box and all the other cans are covered in it and flat from being shaken. i want a refund.
wrong item shipped. my order was for 100 capsules (pack of 2) .  what was received was tablets which i cannot use.  need shipper to rush order the correct iitem
flavorr. the new extreme milk chocolate flavor are nasty it’s just to be better before... you need to improve your flavor is nasty!
"made problems worse. horrible product!. every time i have used this product as recommended i ended up with severe headaches, nightmares and incredible restless sleep or no sleep at all. making things much worse than the usual sleeping problems. when i stop using it the headaches and nightmares are gone. worst and most counter-productive sleeping aid i have ever used! straight into the garbage! stay away!thanks to ""x brand"" for refunding me."
"bad customer service!. when i received the jelly beans the safety seal was broken.  i contacted ""x brand"" and was offered a $7 credit from the seller.  first of all i paid $23 for them second seriously do you this i would give these to my grandchildren with the safety seal broken?!  this is bad customer service!  i will never order from this seller again."

"delivery timing not what expected. always by now essentials oils at store. 1st time order on line. june 12, product should have arrive 21st not showing it’s out of stock, but would arrive 27-28th of june"
"contaminated with heavy metals. i'm just finding out after having consumed at least 25 containers if these in the course of the past 4 years that these raw meal proteins are contaminated with heavy metals. google it if you would like to find out more. it just so happens that i've started having severe brain fog and other issues since 3-4 years ago, and i'm now wondering if consuming these proteins have played a significant role in causing those symptoms."
"liked the old better  but learned to tweak it. i really enjoyed this product before the formula change... even added it to my iced tea & it gave it a nice tart taste like lemon. now there is no tartness. so i add 1/4 tsp. ascorbic acid/vitamin. c to 1 tsp. mag. citrate & i don't mind the taste. to get it to dissolve i've also learned to add 4 tsp. of it to a 1 liter bottle of water, shake it, refrigerate it, & use about 1/4 cup for my dose as needed. totally dissolved, no clumps :0)"
"no results after 45 days. this is a 45 day supply. after finishing the jar, i haven't noticed anything at all with my skin. i wouldnt recommend and i wouldnt try again."
"would totally not recommend. i bought these nature's bounty ginkgo biloba 120mg, 100 capsules, about 6 weeks ago, and shortly after using for a few days, began to experience indigestion on pretty much a daily basis.  tried keeping track of what i was eating, thinking maybe food related, but didn't seem to be.  so stopped taking the capsules, and after a couple of days, no more indigestion.  started taking them again, just to see what would happen, and back to the same problem.  called the company, and asked if indigestion was a side effect of the supplement and the rep, and then his supervisor, said they didn't know.  i asked if they kept any records of customers reporting this side effect, and was told they are not required to keep records, because this is not a prescription medication.  so, unable to get any information whatsoever about the product, but got sick taking it, and wasted money  buying it.  guess i should know better.  they did not offer to reimburse for the capsules....apparently this is not their policy.  would advise against ordering and taking this supplement, which is highly touted in the alternate medicine field."
"bloated. i’ve heard good and bad about monohydrate and hcl, so i had to try this for myself. i have a picky stomach and this did not sit well with me. it makes me feel bloated and like i’m going to vomit, i hope it works for someone but for me it did not. it does not come with a spoon and the seal is very secure, but difficult to take off."
"sickeningly sweet.... this protein powder blended well and has ingredients that i trust, but the taste is terrible as it has been way over sweetened. i am unable to use it after one try as it made me sick due to the over sweetness of it."

"ingredients are becoming cheap. i remember the first time this product came out and i started using it. i used it once or twice a week in the mid morning at a water flavorer and for a boost. 3 years ago, a half scoop or a full scoop would be sufficient. but now, i don't feel the same effect unless i'm putting in 5 scopes. note: i do not take or use pre-workout sups, and i do not have a lot of caffeine in my diet. simply said, i believe the company is taking short cuts to create a greater profit margin, and they will chalk it up to ""your tolerance is increasing."""
"high dose b vitamins and greater than typical overall dosages compared to standard multivitamin.. this is a fairly expensive multivitamin at over twice the cost per daily dose of standard daily multivitamins. much of this likely revolves around the actual content, which is significantly more than a standard multivitamin provides. a standard multivitamin generally has 100% of the recommended daily dose for each ingredient. in this case, however, we see about 20 times that for thiamin and riboflavin (b1 and b2), 15x that for b6, 10x that for b7 (biotin) and b12, and so forth. essentially, you are getting a high dose of the b vitamins, but there's also twice the usual amount of copper, 5x the usual dose of pantothenic acid and well over 100% for vitamins a and c.more of something good is not necessarily a good thing. there are potential side effects for taking more than the recommended quantity of several of the b vitamins. and those with certain medical disorders would want to be careful about several of the other components here. bottom line: talk with your doctor before taking this particular multivitamin formulation, and if you're simply looking for a high quality multivitamin rather than wanting to experiment with high doses of any of these components, look elsewhere. in the meantime, if you do decide to take these, one pill rather than the product-recommended two a day would likely be the right place to start.note that the content and nutritional information on the product label is underneath the main product label, which can be easily peeled back to reveal the information so that it's there on your shelf and won't be confused with other products."
"chalky texture. i tried this product recently as i'm getting ready to go on a pre-op liquid diet and need to drink a lot of protein shakes.  it did not dissolve well in liquid and was very chalky.  the flavor itself was ok, but i couldn't get past the texture.  not a fan."

"blends initially but separates and settles. overall i like this protein powder but there are some pros and cons to it.pros:-flavor isn’t bad-good macros, low carbs, high protein content-blends decently wellcons:-gritty taste-it separates and settles down as if it has sediment.blends initially well but separates as time goes by and if more than an hour goes by it can be really annoying because i might make my shake before leaving for work and it doesn’t work well as something being made for later. this has been the biggest downfall for me. i even had a shake that i didn’t drink the entire thing and by the time i could clean it out that night it had settled on the bottom so much that it was difficult to get the gunk off the bottom. flavor isn’t bad but it’s not as smooth as the other powders i’ve had. will buy another powder when i finish this."

"taste awful. i was hoping these would be easier to eat after first trimester's morning sickness was gone, but no. these taste like a smoothie gone bad. they still make me nauseous. i'd rather just swallow the whole pill."

"do not apply to mucous membranes.. if it burns like fire when it contacts mucous membranes, how friendly can it be to one's stomach and intestinal lining? this little gel cap is loaded with very concentrated oregano oil. it is like an essential oil in its strength."
made me gain weight. i’ve been drinking these shakes for breakfast after my workout  for a little over a year. i noticed i had gained about 10 pounds but figured it was from the birth control i started. i had a busy two weeks so i quit drinking them but would still work in a walk or a quick work out. i lost 5 pounds in that two weeks.  no more shakes for me!
yuck. made me burp a lot and the flavor made me really nauseated (almost had to throw up just writing this remembering).  good quality product but just doesn't stay in place for nauseated pregnant women.

"i really tried. i have always preferred medium roast coffee as the dark roast often has a burnt taste.  although i attempted to change to decaf for health reasons, this stuff was downright nasty. btw, the darker the roast, the less caffeine it has in it as the roasting process burns off the caffeine and the flavor.  i will return to using kirkland's dark roast for now."

"not really impressed. we ordered the watermelon flavored version.  when cold it tastes like creamed bubble gum, once it got warm it tasted like creamed cake.  won't order again, too hard to drink."
stay away. don’t buy product was ineffective did not work
"works like any other melatonin product. i've been using nature's bounty melatonin for sleep and with 1.5 g  i would feel groggy in morning  . so , i thought of giving this a try as reviews left on here said this didn't give any groggy feeling . however , i found it to be no different and because it is one gummy you can't even alter the dosage with this. i think it works no different than any cheaper melatonin ."
tastes awful. also this product is not time released which is really what my doctor recommends. i found buying the name brand in quantity helps. i won't buy this product again. the taste is really off putting.
allergic reaction. i didn’t get to see if it worked or not.  i have a allergic reaction to it. (rash).  i had to quit using it.
wrong item. i received the wrong medicine.the bottle is correct. the pills are not.i have no idea what they are. i am going to throw them away.please refund my purchase. thank you
"too much of a good thing?. i’ve been taking probiotics for years at a much lower dose with no ill effects. then i tried taking this product on the recommendation of a friend (who loves it and swears by it) and felt like i had a mild case of the stomach flu. i even missed a day of work because of the nausea and, ahem,  “other symptoms.”  it took me a whole week to put two and two together, but as soon as i made the connection and stopped taking it, i began to feel much better.i hesitated to give this item one star because it sounds like it’s helping a lot of people out there, but i feel compelled to be honest about my experience.  before you introduce a large amount of bacteria into your system, even if it’s the “good” kind, make sure you really need it. if you overdo it, your immune system will treat it like a foreign invader."

missing directions.. there was no “enclosed leaflet” with “complete directions” included in the package which the instructions on the can refer to
taste nasty. pills have a wood like taste to them.  not very easy to swallow. only got them because the ones i normally buy were out of stock
"bad flavor and texture. i'm not really sure if these are effective, i haven't noticed a difference. i find the flavor and texture to be gross. it's soft, but also gritty and powdery when you chew them. i don't think i'll get them again."

expired product ⚠. ⚠ dangeri just want to put this out there. apparently they sent me a expired product... expired. be careful with what you get online. their customer rep was totally unable to help me so... i just be careful where you put your money at... i what a waste
"taste like sadness. these are the worst tasting vitamins i’ve ever had. i grimace every time i try to eat one. imagine old school metamucil and tums had a baby, that’s these vitamins. i don’t recommend getting them because i personally can’t get used to the awful taste."
it was repackaged. the seal was broken i think i got a used product
no difference!. i have been taking these for about a month a this point and while i have not specifically seen any change or difference in my skin hydration levels - my skin seems to be about the same- slightly dry.the softgel's are a small size and have no taste. they are easy enough to swallow and the color is quiet nice. at the current price of $17.99 for a 45 day supply i would not purchase this once i am finished with this set.
"bad chemical taste. i've seen the monk fruit packets at my local coffee shop and decided to get myself some to try instead of the ez sweetz stuff i've been using (splenda).  it is fairly sweet when i put a drop on my tongue and didn't notice much of a bad after taste.  however, after having to put a generous amount in my coffee (about 7 drops) to get any noticeable sweetness it has a very nasty after taste that ruined my favorite hazelnut coffee."

"07/2019 :(. the product came near the expiration date, ie, i will not be able to consume everything. lack of respect for the consumer, in addition to having paid an expensive freight for my country."
"bad customer service. i received these vitamins totally melted, and in order to return i’m to travel 5 miles before they send me new ones! i’m canceling the reorder of the men’s ! the women vitamins were sent out within the next day. i’m very disappointed with this vendor"
didn’t show up. i never got this in the mail?????
"diluted, do not waste your money like i did. this oregano oil is seriously diluted and a huge rip off. it is the second brand of $30 oregano oil i have purchased from ""x brand"". this is an outrage. i used to buy herbal authority oregano oil from puritan's pride, buy one get 2 free, for $9!!  one drop would numb inflamed gums. it cleared my sinuses when i had a cold. it was fabulous!  but i can no longer find it.  we need to call out egregious consumer fraud when we see it. i am done with oregano oil from ""x brand""."

expired. i received a box of expired bars. very disappointed. this is not acceptable.
never again. do not waste the money buying these. i bought these because they were cheap. i got what i paid for. i'll just spend the money for a more expensive brand. these taste horrible.

it never arrived. it never arrived
"weird, melty texture. i'm not sure if i got a bad batch or what, but these are not normal gummy texture.  it's hard to describe, but they are like gummies that didn't ""set up"" properly - they get stuck on my teeth, and stick going down my throat.based on the bad reviews, it's possibly mine were defective somehow, but the texture of these was so bad that i can't use them."

order not received. did not receive order. waiting to hear back from vendor.
"texture is awful, but otherwise ok. these seem to be working well for a lot of people, but, for me, the texture is very off-putting. they are not like a fruit snack gummy. instead, they are more like a gumdrop or fruit jelly."

"if you can get past the taste and texture...great ingredients. i am determined to finish this due to the price i paid and the great ingredients, but it is slow going.  i did not realize it contained stevia extract which taste bitter to me.  plus the texture is very course, maybe necessary due to the fiber content.  i have tried blending it individually and in combination with plain yogurt, soy milk, coconut water, coffee, and banana (not much other fruit seemed compatible).  i bought it at the beginning of my first low-carb diet and i am not vegan.  i have tried a couple other protein shake mixes since then and this comes in last on low-carb, taste and texture, but again, great ingredients."
"not good for long term contact lens storage. this contact lens solution consistently dries my lenses out. i wear glasses and contacts, however i primarily wear my glasses. when i do wear my monthly contact lenses i often store them for about a week before i put them back on. with this solution my lenses become dry and deformed. it’s like i put peroxide in the case. other brands don’t do this. if you’re not using this solution for long term storage (such as a week or more) it should be fine according to the other reviews."
"nope. didn't work.  way too low probiotics count.  spend the money for a good, high count.  it's worth it in the end."
"comparable to war head candy. i know elderberry can be sour, but i could hardly chew one of these with out making sour faces and cringing! the taste is awful. i returned and got refunded."
"never arrived. this item never arrived and ""x brand"" informed me i had to file a police report if i wanted a refund. not using ""x brand"" again."
pills are good but not the bottle. this is my 2nd bottle but it was broken when i opened package.
"smells like rancid rotting fruit. i ordered the wrong thing and thought i would try it anyway. took the lid off and was assailed by the most rancid, offensive smell! not sure if this bottle is bad or if that is usual, but i won’t be trying these with a smell like that."

"oddly low calcium. i had been taking the kirkland general daily multivitamins (not women specific) and was curious to compare these. to be fair the kirkland ones aren't vegan, but they are also much cheaper, so that's a bit of a wash. these are about 35% bigger than the kirkland vitamins -- quite large, though i didn't have any difficulty swallowing them. they also definitely have a smell, though it's not terrible. the label was oddly hard to read ((maybe mine just had a funky printing job), but the bottle was easy toopen and close. the thing that was weird to me and dropped this to three stars is the very low level of calcium in the vitamins. they only offer 3% of the daily calcium allocation, while standard vitamins are usually 20 to 35%, and women's specific vitamins are usually a bit higher even than that. i don't drink nearly enough milk and have some history of osteoporosis in the family, so calcium is one of the most important supplements i watch for in a daily multivitamins. so that's a deal killer for me -- you could always take an additional supplement, but why bother when almost all other vitamin brands have plenty of cacium? all told, these are fine multivitamins for other nutrients, and bonus points for being vegan, but if you're needing calcium as part of your supplement like i am then you might want to consider another brand."
taste gross. very gross flavor! i couldnt make more than one drink.
"not getting what's shown on my order. i received a different looking product, does not match what i ordered and i hate not getting what i ordered"
smell goes through. yech!. i use these for dog wraps and they don’t work. the urine smell goes through to the wrap. depends pads do not do this. i assume it would be the same situation for people.
melted and useless. arrived completely all melted together. useless
not good. makes me sick. the first time buying this brand and first time turmeric make sick so sick to throw up.  no idea why but wondering if it’s really turmeric

you need 7 pills to take as prescribed!! yikes 7 pills!  really?. made me sick to my tummy.  start slow and build up to the quantity and take on a full stomach!
"like the quality and nutrition of the shake. not hot on the taste.. i had been using the vega essentials drink and decided to try this one instead. i really did not like the flavor as much as the essentials shake and ended up changing back. the shake is otherwise really good. i like the way it blends, and i am able to get the stated 18 servings per container without issue. it keeps me feeling full all morning just like the essentials shake did. i just preferred the taste of the essentials because it’s not quite as sweet. this one tastes almost a cookie, which i don’t i want first thing in the morning."
no change whatsoever. have used this b12 spray for a little over a month now and have not noticed any increase in energy. i was taking 3 sprays/day for over a month and a half and nothing. zip. nada. save your money.
arrived broken and made a mess. i love using grape seed oil and i love this brand. however this arrived broken and made a huge mess. the oil was packed in a brown box with no bubble wrap or anything to prevent it from banging around. then a white bubble envelope around the box but it didn’t prevent the cap from splitting off during shipping. shipped by fedex so no surprise it arrived broken.  i did notify the seller so hopefully they will package the oil with some paper or bubble wrap inside the box for future orders. luckily the safety seal is still in place or else the whole bottle wouldn’t spilled out. i couldn’t figure out how the product came out with the seal still on but then i squeezed the bottle and saw that the oil seeped around the seal. i’ll post a video

bad batch. i like this product but the last one i received the pills were all mashed and melted together.
"glass bottles without any bubble wrap.. i ordered these to send it to my grandma and the broken bottles were arrived. i was surprised that there wasn’t any bubbles in the ""x brand"" box even tho the product is all glasses. very small broken glass fragments were all around in the box and i even hurt my finger while i’m packing it for refund. what a waste. just don’t buy it through here."
"just ok.. while they're ok for occasional use for sleep, they work less well than benadryl but without the nasty side effects. they're not remotely useful for chronic insomnia."
"don't do it!!! causes throat swelling!. please don't use these it cause my throat to swell whenever i took them, after some research i found that this is a common reaction to these (google it). please do not buy these!"
"weird aftertaste makes this a no for me. i mix one scoop of this with 8oz of water, 5-6 cubes of ice, half a banana, and 12 almonds. (my recipe is very precise because i'm counting calories) i think it blends up great in my ninja blender and the initial taste is fine. but about 15 minutes after i drink it, there's a really fishy aftertaste. i think it's the marine algae. i'll try to finish this container, but i wouldn't buy it again."

horrible flavor and texture. do not buy this product unless you love the fake sweet taste of stevia and enjoy a powder that doesn't dissolve in a smoothy. uhhhhggg!

"not as good as others. lacks flavor, but mixes well."

"ordered and paid.  not received. tracking says item delivered yesterday, but not received"
don't buy they get stuck in your throat. value is good because they ate terrible to swallowi never have issues swallowing pills but these are terrible
horrible packaging. the pills have a horrible taste and smell which are apparently coming from the plastic bottle they’re packaged in.  i thought the smell/taste would go away over time but didn’t.
really big capsules. these things are huge. i will not be ordering them again.
"good product, but weird packaging issue. the packaging doesn’t pair well with the product, the plastic seems like it has been stained or absorbed some of the oil somehow leaving it green and kinda gunky."

leak all the time !!. would not buy again.  they leak all the time !!
same as costco. but way too high priced
don’t buy the salted caramel. this flavor tastes like lightly salted dirt. go for a basic flavor like chocolate or vanilla. really disappointed because i love caramel everything but this was a major disappointment.
wrong item sent! do not order from seller. the wrong item was delivered and i am being told i cannot return it!

"shipping misinformation. the product was what i ordered and expected.  i do wish that it was available in bottles of 60 or 100 tablets.my gripe is the outright lies in the shipment tracking!  i have never reviewed any shipment on sunday andd i doubt that i ever will!  also, the carriers rarely bother waiting for us to answer the door, so it is a lie when it says it was handed directly to me!  most of the time, they tap lightly on our door, if at all, then place the package somewhere on our front porch and quickly scurry away.  they even did that with the laser printer. i recently bought!"
"1 out of 10 is extremely bad!. i was so excited to find these, i bought 2 jars. terribly disappointed. the marcona almonds i fell in love with have an oily taste. these are very dry. and powdery with salt. but the worst part is every 10th nut or so is so bad tasting that it makes me nervous to eat any more. i will not buy again."

gross taste. this was the most disgusting kids vitamin! i couldn’t even chew it without cringing! how would my kids take this daily? no way. totally waste of money because we’ve only used 3 of them and it’s going in the garbage. do not buy!

"be careful of deals that are too good to be true.. i did not receive 2 bottles for one. i texted the company who did nothing. thankfully ""x brand"" refunded my money. buyer beware."

expiration dates!. i just received my bottle yesterday and they expire in july 2019
"i'd try something else,  didn't do anything for me. didn't really notice any difference with the pill versus without."
"great nutrients but terrible texture. i love all that is in this, but the texture is super grainy and can only be tolerable with blended ice and lots of work. i won't be buying again because i can't drink it straight from a blender bottle even with milk. i can't even imagine trying it with water, it would be a waste of the powder and the water."
are you serious!!!. i am so pissed off! this thing was sent in the smallest envelope only to break and leak it's contents all over clothes and shit after a trip a to south america. now i cant get this fish smell out
"seal and cap broken. product arrived with cap broken and seal not intact. i do not want to use product for fear it may be tampered with. this was a fairly expensive product, so i am unhappy that i paid so much for something i am unable to use. will not be ordering again."
wrong product. received the wrong item and currently still have issues returning to receive the correct product.
"gave me a headache. i guess i am not deficient in dopamine. this stuff gave me a headache the moment i took it. before taking any supplementation, i would recommend a blood test to see what you are deficient in. after spending lots of money and time on experimentation, a blood test revealed what i needed to take. after starting a supplement regimen geared towards that, i feel 1000% better."
i did not receive my order!. i am very disappointed.  i did not receive my nordic naturals fish oil order.  the shipping container left at my door had been torn open and contents removed.  the delivery person range my door bell but it took a few moments for me to get to the door.  i opened my door just as the delivery truck was driving away.  i am a longtime customer and this is the first time i have encountered this problem.

"bad packaging.. the glycerin might be good, but the packaging was terrible. the lid was broken and not all the pieces were even in the box! so i can't even glue it together. did it start with half the lid?? i knew from the oil stains on the outside of the box that things were not good inside it. product had spilled. perhaps a packing pillow would have been beneficial. can't review the product yet, but packaging was a big fail!"

"lumpy texture. i have used this product before and it was fine, 5 stars quality.  but this batch is lumpy (small, soft lumps) .  i know it says ""shake well"", but i have shaken it very well for some time.  the texture is just not appetizing this way."
"no effect, not impressed. i'm not impressed by this, it had no effect on cognition for me."
"beware: misleading label and description. in the pictures and bullet points they provided, they did not say anything about this product being manufactured in a facility that contains shellfish. they need to call this out."
"makes you super nauseated. i have a pretty iron stomach, and my stomach never hurts while taking medications or things that cause nausea. every time i took this vitamin i felt sick to my stomach 20 minutes later. last for about half an hour."
"these are not similar to depends!. i got these for my 73 year old mother who lives with me and has severe oab.  from the description of product, i expected them to be like depends briefs but with side tabs for easy removal. these are nothing like depends. they are bulky and are sent flat like a child’s diaper. sizing seems incorrect as well. the pad part was huge but did not fit my mom around the waist. my mother tried but couldn’t get them on by herself. for reference, she is 5’4 & 140 lbs and we ordered  a size medium. these are not discrete or functional for an active adult or senior.they are also not briefs and they must be applied by a caregiver to a person in a lying down position."
"maybe i've got counterfeit or maybe they've changed something. maybe i've got counterfeit or maybe they've changed something but flavor is different (disgusting) from what i used to buy from body building.comyou can compare two bottles on my images. on the left the one i've got from ""x brand"". on the right from bb."
"not wet enough. these are nice and thick, but not very wet. i’ve been using much more expensive water wipes and i hoped these would be equivalent. unfortunately they are not. i guess i’ll just keep paying for the other ones."
bad smell!. i tried to change all supplements my family takes to gummy. this one smell bad and almost make me threw up every day.i have goose bump with the odor of the gummy daily.

package was empty!. i didn’t like the fact that i received an empty package !  nothing in it and the package was open. the delivery girl took the empty package with her. not sure that was a good idea. help !  what do i do ?debra cordenizdebrat7777@gmail.com559 303-6766
it's okay.... i guess.. it worked for muscle growth..... but even though it says not flavored doesn't mean that it doesn't have a nasty taste..... it just means that they didn't add flavoring. the raw creatine taste itself is disgusting.
impossible to swallow!. i've never had trouble swallowing pills -- i can often do it even without water.  but these are ridiculous.  i break them in half and down each half with a full glass of water and they still get stuck in my throat.  the only way i can ingest them is by crushing each one up and putting it in my cereal.  ugh.

gross. even for protein shakes i just couldn’t drink these. the flavor was horrible. really gross taste.
horse pills. size! too big!
"terrible packaging. packaging was horrible! this should’ve been sent in a box. instead, it was shipped like this and arrived sticky and with syrup inside of the package!"

"undrinkable. chocolate creme flavor was absolutely not palatable without choking. i've had on proteins before, and i can only imagine this was a manufacturing error based on the strange, synthetic flavor profile i experienced."
"synthetic ascorbic acid! bad!!. this is ascorbic acid!! it’s a synthetic, mostly made from gmo corn, and bad for you! and has corn syrup!!"
did not receive product.. product was not delivered.
don’t order from this company. the product never arrived and i have yet to get a refund
pills go bad. the pills always go bad
ok product. too sweet
"tried them, went back to centrum.. the tablets are huge and coating peeled, making them very hard to swallow they're also not as potent as centrum and are more expensive. many of ""x brand""'s brands are excellent-good value and great quality. ""x brand"" should send these back to the quality folks for a complete overhaul."

"smells so bad. some reviews said it smelled bad, and i think ""oh, it probably just smells like cheap detergent-y smell. a little strong and unpleasant, but whatever.""no, it is nothing like gross industrial soap smell. it smells shockingly awful. it's impossible to describe the smell, as i've never smelled anything like it before, but it is just truly unpleasant. i tried to use it a few times, and gave up. i can't. i decided to just throw it out. i am a person who feels terribly guilty about wasting. but this is just the most terrible soap and i'll be happy to never breathe it again."

"don’t waste your money!. i bought this august 2018. i barely used it when i first bought it. i went to use it today and noticed it expired december 2018! i was sent a product that expired within a few months, but has a manufacturing date of 2016! that’s 2 years prior to when i received this junk!"
"does not work. bought these for my daughter thinking it would help her be more calm and not stressed out, but that was a huge mistake buying them since she has been using them for almost a week now and no difference in how she acts or feels. many people reviewed that they have helped them, but i am sending them back since i feel like i wasted my money"

does not contain iron. i bought these because i'm anemic late in my pregnancy and it's because i hate swallowing vitamins and just never get around to taking them.  should have read the nutrition facts more closely--these do not contain iron.  gah.  i guess i'll just set an alarm on my phone to take my vitamins and save these for after baby is born.
don't waste your time. would give it a zero if i could. never even received it as it was damaged and returned. will never buy from here again!

product was spoiled. i’ve purchased kirkland olive oil in the past: generally good product at a good price. this particular jug was rancid tasting. not the usual product.
"tasty but very sweet - not sugar coated. the wild cherry flavor is enjoyable, albeit is very sweet tasting. i'm glad these gummies aren't coated in sugar, but i'm sure they still aren't good for your teeth as they are very soft & sticky while chewing them.  you need to eat 3 for a full serving, and a serving is 35 calories.  they taste like straight up candy. i feel quasi guilty eating these before breakfast, lol.if candy is your jam, than have at them. if you try to avoid extra sweets, then i strongly recommend you skip these."

"beware of stomach cramps. after 2nd use, i woke in middle of the night w/ severe stomach cramps. it was so bad, i was in fetal position on the floor. the pain subsided after 10 min or so, but i'm afraid to try this again or experiment because the discomfort was so painful. i'm relieved that others had this same experience only because it helped pinpoint what the problem was -- these pills. i do use the brand's other products like green coffee bean & raspberry ketones, but i will discontinue these. use at your own risk!"

not effective. big time overrated
"doesn't blend well.. this collagen is unflavored so the taste is palatable, however, it does not mix well in liquids no matter what u do (i used a stick blender). i haven't used it long enough to see any benefit but i would not recommend it simply based on the amount you have to use and the fact that it doesn't blend well."
tastes bad.. i wish i had read the reviews for the product before purchasing. i agree with the comments about the taste- it is sickly sweet.  i’ll be trying another brand.

doesn’t work. rubbish
"got sick within an hour after consuming it. i tried half a scoop mixed in water and within an hour, my heart rate went up and my thyroid nodules were flared. there's some ingredient in this powder that kicked my thyroid gland into overdrive."
"look for another brand!!!!. this does not stir in easily or dissolve. it’s clumpy and gooey. also, there is a strong taste. i’ve used other collagen supplements before and never had these issues. i purchased this based on recommendations from ""x brand"". very disappointed."
poorly cut bags.. all the bags in one of the rolls was miss cut so the whole side of the bag is blown out. only about 5% of the bags were usable.
product packaging/ sealing needs improvement.. product burst opened in the box and created a mess in my room (and residues of it in the mailbox). hard to clean and impossible to return.

horrible stomach side effects. very small and easy to swallow- no flavor at all- but left me with my stomach in knots/horrible bloating each time i tried taking it. will not be purchasing again.

increase ldl - bad cholesterol. good but it increases the bad cholesterol- ldl.it doesn’t suite me.
thick-like paste consistency. will not buy the powder again.
