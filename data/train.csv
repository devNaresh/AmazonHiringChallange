"the value is great, an no bloat...but that taste!!!! blech!!!. i thought all of the other reviews about the taste were just a bunch of people whining because it doesn't taste like a chocolate bar or a dessert....boy, was i wrong! let me be clear...its not the worst tasting powder out there, its actually mildly sweet and not too artificial tasting. but it does have a weird smell to it and unless you are mixing it with frozen berries and other flavor enhancing items you will notice a not so good taste to it. just like other reviews have mentioned, it does clump...a lot...but thats the nature of casein proteins so you can't really complain about that i guess. i mix mine in a nutribullet with a bunch of other stuff to minimize the taste. i will say that where this powder gets my respect is in the fact that up until now it has never made me feel bloated or overly full like many other powders. even though i am rating it three stars i might just buy it again shockingly because it doesn't bloat me like all the other casein powders. in the end i am happy with the product but not ecstatic. maybe the three stars is a bit harsh now that i think about it, maybe its like 3 and 1/2 stars...but i simply can't give it a 4 star rating....oh well, sue me. lol.",Texture

"beware - caused bad ibs symptoms for me. i am not a big product reviewer, but i felt others should be aware of my experience in case the same thing happens to them. i started taking this calcium supplement about a year ago when trader joe’s discontinued the ones i had taken for about a decade. i didn’t put two and two together for months, but these caused chronic diarrhea for me, which has never been an issue for me before. at first i attributed it a prescription, then stress, then thought maybe i had developed lactose intolerance. i tried eliminating wheat, then dairy, then tried the whole30 elimation diet- nothing helped.  i even got a celiac disease test and had my tsh levels checked in case those were the cause of the problem.  even my doctor ran out of ideas. then i noticed that whenever i travelled my symptoms would disappear, and started focusing on things that were different when i traveled. i don’t take my vitamins along and then also realized all the problems started when i switched calcium brands.  i stopped taking them and symptoms disappeared in 48 hours, after months of daily misery and way too much time wasted in the bathroom.  i don’t know what is in this supplement that’s causing the problem, but i have never had an issue with a vitamin before. you couldn’t pay me to take these again. i am steering clear of this brand now because i don’t trust their products anymore.",Allergic

"just bought this product, my initial opinion. i'm a real person. i bought the gnc pro bulk 1340 expecting the god of all protein powders, but my initial overall opinion of this powder is lackluster.i thought “gainer 1340” was just a cool name for a protein powder. i felt stupid to realize that this was the amount of calories that were in 4 full servings of this product. which is a lot. which is good. it means this thing must be loaded with carbs and protein right?? well, not the case actually. comparing this product with my previous mass gainer that ran out, i was surprised to find out that this powder had over double the calories, but still less carbs and protein than my previous powder! which begs the question where are all these calories coming from. well judging on the taste of it, probably sugar. it is a very sweet drink that taste quite nice compared to most other products. it has a little artificial taste, but overall it went down smooth. also the amount of vitamin d in this powder is insanely low compared to my previous powder. this powder screams cheap filler protein powder to me. i would not recommend this product at all, unless you are really struggling to gain weight and want a protein powder that is palatable and calorie dense. scoop sizes are a little bigger than average, but doable. also it’s important to note this product has a gram of creatine monohydrate per 4 servings, so if you are at all worried about the male pattern baldness side effect from taking creatine. i would stay away from all protein powders that have it in them. i do not look forward to forcing myself to drink this powder for a month. it is 650 calories over my previous shake, so i guess i’ll start running 6 miles now. also i’m going to have to find foods to replace the missing carbs and protein that i got when i bought this product.fyi this is just my initial review. i'll take this for a month and probably leave another review.",Too Sweet

"taste good but 5g sugars and 93mg oil (you need 300-600mg daily). these taste like candy. why wouldn't they? there's 2.5 grames of sugar (sucrose glucose) in every piece.there's only 93mg of omega 3 fatty acids (dha+epa) per serving which is laughable. this is not a fish oil supplement. this is a candy that has some fish oil in it - an amount that is negligible.in comparison, 1 serving of the fish oil supplement i take, viva naturals, has 2000mg of omega 3 fatty acids (dha+epa). that's literally more than 20x the amount these gummies are. and that's more than sufficient for the daily amount you should be taking, which is 400-600mg.in conclusion, these taste great, maybe eat them after eating proper serving of fish oil supplements. but if you need to avoid sugar, i would avoid these as the sugar content will add up. you may end up eating 4 like myself because they taste so good. that's 10g of sugar.i only write this negative review for those who really require omega 3 supplements and may think these are sufficient, they are not.",Ingredients

"recipe changed.. aweful smell and taste. contain oyster and shellfish. i've always enjoyed on products for their natural line of ingredients in their formulas. i purchase other vitamins, proteins and amino formulas that they offer and never had any issues with them. they don't use a lot of additives like sugar and chemical dyes that would otherwise make products taste better. i would get a lot of headaches and side effects like nausea and tiredness from similar leading brands and so this was another huge reason i continued with on products. the last couple of batches of these vitamins in particular have been getting worse and worse. they note on the bottle that the vitamins contain shellfish and oyster now. they do have a coating and are smaller as they advertise which i'm assuming helps you swallow it quicker too so you don't have to taste it for very long in your mouth. i have also noticed that the pills will crack and crumble if they are exposed to air or light for a day or so. i took some with me when i flew across the country and although they were enclosed in another bottle they started separating and breaking down. i have been purchasing on vitamins for years and never had quality problems or complaints before. i hope they can improve their formula soon because i would hate to jump ship to another company.",Allergic

"horrific smell.. i thought this might be a good replacement for my generic great value brand coal tar shampoo, however it smells so bad that i can't continue to use it. of course, no coal tar shampoo smells like roses, but i find that the smell of the great value version isn't that offensive and it goes away as my hair dries. the smell of this shampoo lingered strongly for at least 24 hours until i could wash my hair again. if you have a sensitive nose, it might be rough. the smell kept waking me up as i tried to sleep after my shower. i wish they could figure out a way to make my sweet smelling shampoos cling to the hair for as long as this did. it's difficult to describe, very chemical, like being in a cloud of cheap industrial air freshener all day long, very choking if you're sensitive to strong odors.i did notice that my hair was very soft and clean after using it, for what it's worth. i have mild dermatitis along my hairline as well as general general dryness and itching that i aggravate with too hot showers. the great value version keeps this under control very well. i don't intend to finish this bottle to find out if it works as well. i bought this for the convenience of delivery, but i won't purchase it again.",Quality/Contaminated

"ok option. these are pretty similar in texture/odor/moistness to the ""x brand"" elements brand of unscented wipes that we usually get. they are not very similar to water wipes which are thicker and a lot moister. water wipes also have much fewer ingredients - the ingredient list on these mama bear wipes is reasonably lengthy.as far as the ingredients, the ewg does not approve of phenoxyethanol or sodium benzoate (rated a 4 & a 3 respectively).i think these work fine for the typical use case of cleaning up your baby's bottom but also around the house as i often use baby wipes for the highchair, toys, etc. they don't have a discernible scent or odor. they haven't irritated my baby or myself when i've used them to blow my nose in the absence of tissues (some wipes sting).overall i think these are fine - they have a few ingredients that seem iffy but are likely still better than your typical baby wipes.",Allergic

"buyer beware!. i just found out that the type of b12 used in this supplement contains cyanide in the form of a synthetic additive called cyanocobalamin - read the label. the cyanide is organically bound to vitamin b12, and it has a potential for causing harm unless a person is in optimum health to begin with and their liver is able to effectively remove it. if a person's system is already dealing with toxin exposure (from the air we breathe, the water we drink, foods we eat, or any alcohol consumption or take prescription drugs of any kind), or you're one of the many people unable to metabolize b12 properly, it could mean that higher levels of cyanide are building up in your body and caution is advised. smokers, too, can run into trouble and should be careful to avoid this type of b12. unfortunately i didn't find this information out until after i'd consumed 1/2 the bottle. i've since learned that you can get biologically active b12 through diet by eating foods like white button mushrooms, chlorella, and spirulina, which are great sources. and, if you do need to supplement b12, you can get it safely by shopping for cyanide-free forms of b12 such as hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, or aquacobalamin, which i'm going to do from now on. after all, supplements are supposed to improve our health, not damage it. green med info notes that the methylcobalamin form is the ideal variety (because it is the form that is found in nature and is ready for your body to put to use right away), although it does carry a higher price tag.",Packaging

use it to fry toe nail fungus. this is pricey for the size but it lasts long when you use it for getting rid of nail fungus.  i just pour 2- drops in the cap then dip a very small paintbrush (the brush hair part is only about the size of a long grain of rice.  i only use this brush for my nails) and apply it to my nails.  the first week or so it stings the skin mild to medium when it gets on the skin.  if you wipe the skin with water this really helps take away the sting on the skin.  another thing that  helps is put lotion around the nail before you apply the oil.  the lotion reduces/removes the sting.  either way the stinging goes away after a week.  it is not that bad and it lasts about half an hour if you don't wipe the skin.  i have only tried it for a short time with oregano oil and peppermint oil (which has menthol) and it does look like it is healing the nails some.  i think i will also get some rosemary oil for some camphor and other antimicrobial properties.  i also like these oils because i regularly eat these herbs so i feel that they are safe for me.  many years back i mixed a lot of essential oils and my nails were almost healed and then i didn't keep up the regular application of oils.  this time i am not stopping until the nails are clear.,Quality/Contaminated

"contraindications about excessive folic acid intake during pregnancy (222%). ""x brand"" brand revly vegan prenatal multivitamin contains many vitamins that basic prenatals do not include. the american pregnancy association recommends a variety of vitamins and these vitamins are included in this formula. this formula does a few unusual things compared to other prenatal multivitamins. it has more thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, b6, b12, folate, chromium, pantothenic acid, and vitamin a. all of these vitamins are over 100% of the daily value in some of them are over 200% of the daily value.  the reason why i am opting out of taking two of these a day is that of the percent of folic acid in the formula. there is 222% of folic acid in the formula and experts are led to believe that sometimes too much folic acid is not good for the baby. there are several contraindications about taking an excess of 100% of the daily value on the health of the baby. the values in this formula do not coincide with the values recommended by the american pregnancy association.  i like that there is a probiotic blend and i also like that there is an organic sprout blend in the formula. there is an organic botanical blend as well.  this botanical blend contains some herbs that are not usually recommended during pregnancy.  these herbs are found in this formula as a powder and my assumption is that they are not potent enough to make a negative impact. some of the botanicals that are not recommended include peppermint leaf, lemon balm, lavender, and clove. these botanicals are considered uterine stimulants which are not recommended in pregnancy. i personally do not feel uncomfortable with these ingredients because they are at a low dose.  however, someone that is sensitive to these ingredients may want to be aware that they are in the formula.  the vitamin values in this formula are higher than usual and the herbs are slightly unusual for pregnancy.  this has not made me feel ill but i will not be taking it any longer during pregnancy but perhaps post pregnancy.",Ingredients

"not the best quality of creatine spend a few more bucks for better quality. background- i am 31 years old, 6'3 218 lbs about 13% bf right now, i played semi pro football from 19 to 21, i was a fitness trainer at 24 hour fitness from 23 to 25 so i know a very good amount about working out. i currently play basketball in a mens adult league and i do mma twice a week, and have been doing this for the last 7 years. my first cycle creatine run since i was 25.pros- i did have a very fast recovery despite my intense workouts, currently used this product for 8 weeks straight. i did lose 14 lbs in 8 weeks almost all body fat and did gain some muscle as i took this while cutting but still consuming 1g of protein per body lb, stacking with glutamine, and bcaas. so i can't necessarily say the fast recovery because of the creatine. i did do this with a loading phase for 5 days and 5 grams per day afterwards while drinking 2/3s to 1 gallon of water per day for 8 weeks straight.cons- i have used better creatine in the past and can tell you when stacking it with glutamine and high quality bcass, the muscle growth was much better in the past. i think there is much better and higher quality creatine out there. my recommendation if your going to jump on creatine and put in all the effort and time in the gym spend a few more bucks and getting something of higher quality. right now i am going to take 4 weeks off of creatine as i just finished my 8 week cycle and going to try threeatine by crazy muscle on my next run. little more expensive for the quantity but i have heard great things about it and will jump on that on july 1rst. nope sure if it's any better but i will not buy this product again. hope this helped anybody on the fence about this product.",Pricing

"natures made prenatal gummies-sweet vitamin treat. nature made prenatal gummies are a supplemental gummy that are designed to provide extra vitamins to mom and growing baby all while being a sweet treat.  nature made prenatal gummies contains 7 grams of carbohydrates and 5 grams of sugar per two gummies. they may not be suitable for those on a low-carb low-sugar diet.  they have a sugary coating and are sweetened with sugar, glucose sugar, and sucrose.  my preference would be that they were sweetened with a healthy sugar substitute like stevia.  nature made prenatal gummies are unique because they contain a small amount of dha and epa. they are a rather large gummy and have a raspberry type of flavor.  the flavor is decent but it took me a bit to get used to the sweetness.  this gummy was easy on my stomach and was good as an after dinner treat.  this would be a good gummy for someone who gets daily sweet cravings.  i find that i could go without the sugar coating and that they would likely still be enjoyable all while being healthier. they also are missing a few of the recommended vitamins for pregnancy. those additional vitamins can be supplemented. this is a very basic formula that can be used as a supplementation to a woman's daily diet.  it is good for women who have had trouble with prenatals as it is not hard on the stomach.",Packaging

"compare to centrum & centrum knockoff ..... this solimo 50+ daily vitamin is certainly a value-for-the-money item. with plenty of doses (125 tablets) for just under $5, you really cannot beat that cost. however, compare it to my bargain-brand centrum knockoff, which has 100 tablets for about the same cost, and there is more percentage of the vitamins/minerals in most of the types, and i receive just a few less per bottle. as well, compare it to centrum silver, which is roughly twice as much, but you have that trusted name, and more vitamins/minerals as well in the centrum.while i’m not sure that more percentage of vitamins/minerals matters—what we don’t need we release from our bodies unused—if you want more percentages, and as well if you want iron (there’s no iron in these solimo), then you may want to compare brands as well and make a choice that fits you and fits your budget.i will take these solimo, but likely will return to the centrum knockoff i’ve been taking for quite some time now—the prices are around the same (with solimo maybe a little cheaper), but i’ll be receiving a little more bang for my buck.however, solimo brand has no weird taste or weird odor to it, so that’s a good thing.  what it also has going for it is: no artificial flavors, no gluten (if that matters to you and it doesn’t to me), and no lactose. that would make me take a second look at perhaps crossing over to the solimo for the no artificial flavors and no lactose. i’m still on the fence and deciding.it’s really not possible to know exactly what’s happening to my body on a cellular level with vitamins/minerals i take, or to know any real difference between the solimo and the brand i am taking—it’s unlikely i will feel any difference in my body and energy, etc—so, i have to go on the smaller details.all in all not a bad vitamin. compare what’s in it with your usual multi and see what fits your own needs.",Bad Taste/Flavor

"it is using splenda as a sweetener. i have been fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to review quite a few protein powders lately.i just reviewed a competitor’s vanilla protein shake so i will use it for comparison.muscletech nitrotech claims to have the purest whey protein formula available. i am not exactly sure what it means by purest. it seems in this case that it is the amount of whey protein isolate in the powder compared to the competitors. it goes further by comparing the % of protein per scoop with some competitors. in this case, it has 86% when the best competitor would have 84%.let’s compare the supplement facts:muscletech: 100kcal per scoop (29g) versus 111kcal for competitorfat: 0% for bothcarbs: same for both at less than 1gproteins: same for both at 25gsodium: 300mg for mt versus 185mg for competitoringredients for muscletech:250mg of prohydrolase tm (protease 125mg + bromelain 125mg), whey protein isolate 97%, gum blend, natural and artificial flavors, calcium carbonate, salt, soy or sunflower lecithin, silicon dioxide, sucralose (splenda), acesulfame-potassium.competitior:whey protein isolate (milk), natural flavors, sunflower lecithin, stevia leaf extract.by just comparing the two lists, muscletech does not look like a winner. it uses artificial sweetener and much more ingredients than its competitor to give about the same amount of proteins. it has also almost twice the amount of sodium.taste wise, they both are similar.price wise, muscletech is about 30% more expensive per lbs.once this is said, muscletech has built a solid reputation over the years in the bodybuilding community.in conclusion:in itself this protein powder seems a pretty good deal. however, if like me, you are concerned about artificial sweeteners and are searching for supplements that are as simple as possible, you may need to search elsewhere. it exists and can be even cheaper.3 stars.",Bad Taste/Flavor

"buyer beware!. i just found out that the type of b12 used in this supplement contains cyanide in the form of a synthetic additive called cyanocobalamin - read the label. the cyanide is organically bound to vitamin b12, and it has a potential for causing harm unless a person is in optimum health to begin with and their liver is able to effectively remove it. if a person's system is already dealing with toxin exposure (from the air we breathe, the water we drink, foods we eat, or any alcohol consumption or take prescription drugs of any kind), or you're one of the many people unable to metabolize b12 properly, it could mean that higher levels of cyanide are building up in your body and caution is advised. smokers, too, can run into trouble and should be careful to avoid this type of b12. unfortunately i didn't find this information out until after i'd consumed 1/2 the bottle. i've since learned that you can get biologically active b12 through diet by eating foods like white button mushrooms, chlorella, and spirulina, which are great sources. and, if you do need to supplement b12, you can get it safely by shopping for cyanide-free forms of b12 such as hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, or aquacobalamin, which i'm going to do from now on. after all, supplements are supposed to improve our health, not damage it. green med info notes that the methylcobalamin form is the ideal variety (because it is the form that is found in nature and is ready for your body to put to use right away), although it does carry a higher price tag.",Ingredients

"really delicious flavor but less vitamin/supplement than taking pills - vitamin infused candy. the olly beauty gummies are a great gummy to take if you’re looking for a non pill form of biotin to take.  like most gummy vitamins, these vitamins are pretty much vitamin infused candy.  these gummies taste so yummy - they’re soft and chewy and have a nice sweet grapefruit flavor.  the ingredients include glucose syrup, beet sugar, water, gelatin, natural flavor, citric acid, pectin, coloring from various fruits and vegetable juices, vegetable oil, and carnauba wax.  these vitamins include vitamin c, vitamin e, biotin, and keratin.  most of the supplements are small - vitamin c (15mg/17% dv), vitamin e (7.5mg/50%dv), and keratin (50mg/dv not established) - but the biotin supplement is huge (2500mcg/8333% dv) but it’s still lower than taking a small biotin pill.  i normally take biotin as a supplement in pill form, and the one i’m taking includes 7500 mcg/25000% dv.  as a non pill supplement, i would totally take these simply because i love the flavor.  however, i personally don’t mind swallowing pills, so i would unlikely purchase these in the future unless i want to mix things up and have a candy vitamin to take.  overall, these are great if you want to avoid taking pills, but these have less vitamins so be aware.",Too big to swallow

"way too much sodium per serving. !!!!!!--->>300 mg of sodium per 1 scoop serving, with a recommended 1-2 scoops- possibly multiple times a day. ""use between major meals and before and after exercise"" woah. do the math! if you plan to use this to add some protein once a day and all else is pretty clean, then have at it. if you are using this to bulk up and need multiple servings each day (and/or are consuming anything canned, boxed, processed, or made in a restaurant), then beware, be mindful, and take heed to the excess sodium you are taking in. maybe blood pressure isn't an issue for you, but what about those excess pounds while you are trying to shred? excess sodium is not your friend.---dietary guideline for sodium is no more than 2300 mg, per day. through food, drinks, and additional spices we easily top 3400mg or more. the idea is to push it back under 2000mg. so most people would do well to avoid high sodium products like this. the caveat is if you are someone who would benefit from replacing lost electrolytes from intense sweat producing workouts if the replenishment beverage also contains a balance of potassium and natural sugar. this product is not made to address that. there is no potassium in this product, and the only sugar comes from sucralose (like, little yellow packets of splenda).  the sodium appears to be for taste.even competitors have high sodium, but the highest brand is about half of what is here- given same amount of protein and grams per serving. crazy.-----now that is just about sodium. what's up with sucralose (splenda) being used to sweeten it up? i won't get into the potential health hazard of these artificial sweeteners, but i will say that artificial sweeteners can make us want more sugary foods- which is not helpful when we are trying to lose weight, or aiming to add muscle to our body. just drop the sweetener and maybe blend or shake in something cleaner, and easier on the mind and body.**don't care about any of that? here are some positives..--> taste. ok, so overall taste is fine. i used some unsweetened almond milk, ice, and a scoop of this product in a blender. the vanilla taste was rather bland. i typically like to blend in some frozen fruit and a couple of supplements, so the protein powder typically just serves as a base. after i made the basic smoothie, i added in a half of an under ripe banana. that seemed to make the vanilla pop, and the over taste improved.---> protein absorption. one thing thing product has over some is that this product contains digestive enzymes which research alludes to being vital in assisting in protein absorption, which is what we want from a protein powder. 125 mg each of protease and bromelain for 250mg digestive enzyme blend.i like this last bit, a lot,  but the excess sodium will make me take a closer look at other products. i have a tendency to retain water as it is, so this is a no go for me. i think it is an easy fix for this company if enough people express sodium concerns.",Shipment and delivery

insane burning/itching sensation!!!. crazy intense itching had me thinking i was having an allergic reaction! i’m staying with my parents for the week and decided to take some of this bc my dad has it in the house. i took a full scoop (blissfully unaware that new users shouldn’t take the whole serving) i mean come on if that’s the cash they should write that under the recc dosage. i have taken the original c4 (yellow packaging) and also performix pre workout and felt nothing like this. it started with my face and hands the itching was so bad i had to fight not to scratch. the worst part arguably was sorry tmi alert my private parts itching that badly?!?? i felt like i had an infection or an allergic reaction of some kind. i looked it up and say the ingredients beta alanine and niacin are responsible for this side effect. another weird thing was that i didn’t sweat at all during my workout. and it was ab day the hardest of the week. all that being said i was able to go harder and longer than usual but that itch is tew much and not worth it😭,Texture

"fall from grace. i've been really disappointed with my c4 experience over the years. it's been a fall from grace. the watermelon flavor used to be sweet and pack a punch like a jolly rancher--it was fantastic. this was about 5 years ago. i continued to order c4 for another year after that, then the recipe changed to a much milder version. it was a shell of its former self. from there, i made a fuss about my annoyance with the change of flavor, so i stopped for a couple years, trying some every now and then to find out if they had changed it back. it never happened, until recently!  except the flavor wasn't changed back to the great old flavor, it was changed to this new variant. it tastes like a slightly sweeter watermelon n.o. xplode.n.o. xplode always upset my stomach, and since it was much cheaper, i suspect this was a part of the problem. for c4 to go this route of a new recipe for the second time in only a few years is really disappointing. it really feels like cellucor is out to cut corners, and this time it's apparent with it's similarity to n.o.",Bad Taste/Flavor

"puncture your pill and smell the oil!!. as i’m learning more about fish oil, i learned that when it is punctured, the oil should not smell or taste fishy. truly fresh fish oil should not have a fishy smell or taste. it is recommended to test your fish oils before using. after i had learned of this, i tested mine out (this exact brand). the bottle had never been opened since i had bought a two package deal. i took one and punctured it. it had a very fishy smell. apparently, when there is a fishy smell, it means that oxidation has set in, making the oil rancid. this is good to know and i’m glad i learned of it. it’s also been recommended to get fish oil with vitamin e to help prevent rancidity as well as to refrigerate after opening.i learned this while reading “what would jesus eat” by don colbert. i seriously love this book so far. lots of factual information.",Ingredients

"skin discoloration/darkening on baby. i believe these prenatals had something to do with my son being born with skin discoloration. this darkening of the skin goes around his right eye, above his right eye on forehead (the length of the discoloration is about as long as his eyebrow from left to right) and it also goes down his right temple. aside from this pretty big ""birth mark"" which is how anyone would assume this darkening of the skin is called, on the right side of his face, there are different smaller discoloration patches, slightly darker than the color of his skin. i was very sick during my 1st pregnancy and couldn't take any prenatals. i ended up taking gummy prenatals to get at least something like folate etc. i made a huge effort to even swallow the gummies - that's how sick i was. my 1st son wasn't born with any skin discoloration/darkening issues, this isn't an issue that runs in either one of our families. he is perfectly healthy, intelligent and happy. i believe these prenatals had something to do with this because a friend of mine got pregnant at the same time with her sixth child, was very sick and since i had just started taking these, i recommended them to her. she didn't take prenatals before with any of her pregnancies and all of her kids were born with normal even skin tone throghout their bodies except her last baby. her daughter just like my son was  born with a discoloration/darkening of the skin. her baby's dark patch is located around the left temple towards her hair line. this discoloration is of a considerable size as well and darker than the color of her skin. i don't think it's a coincidence that the only pregnancy that she took prenatals, this brand, vitamin code raw prenatals from garden of life, had something to do with it. i have tan skin, my friend's skin is black. has anyone had something happen like this to their child on any part of their bodies? and took these prenatals during that pregnancy? i highly appreciate if you share this with me. i took my prenatals from around june 2017 all the way until around jan 2019, i started around two months before conceiving and through breastfeeding. my son's darkening of the skin showed up at around 4 weeks of age and became evident around 3 months old.",Allergic

"fall from grace. i've been really disappointed with my c4 experience over the years. it's been a fall from grace. the watermelon flavor used to be sweet and pack a punch like a jolly rancher--it was fantastic. this was about 5 years ago. i continued to order c4 for another year after that, then the recipe changed to a much milder version. it was a shell of its former self. from there, i made a fuss about my annoyance with the change of flavor, so i stopped for a couple years, trying some every now and then to find out if they had changed it back. it never happened, until recently!  except the flavor wasn't changed back to the great old flavor, it was changed to this new variant. it tastes like a slightly sweeter watermelon n.o. xplode.n.o. xplode always upset my stomach, and since it was much cheaper, i suspect this was a part of the problem. for c4 to go this route of a new recipe for the second time in only a few years is really disappointing. it really feels like cellucor is out to cut corners, and this time it's apparent with it's similarity to n.o.",Allergic
"before you buy, read this!. there are a lot of adaptogens on the market with positive effects similar to ashwagandha but without some of the side effects. for example, rhodiola can combat stress and anxiety and improve mood. when it comes to ashwagandha, the skin itchiness is real. after several days of taking the now ashwagandha supplement, the itching became intolerable.unfortunately the itchiness is worst at night. my last dose was sunday night and i wasn't able to sleep most of that night. it took multiple doses of benadryl and melatonin, and hours of nearly involuntary scratching before i was able to get some sleep in stretches of 10-15 minutes in between tortuous bouts of painful itching.i'm now writing this monday night and the itchiness has returned, as painful and debilitating as it was yesterday. another restless night. apparently it takes more than 24 hours for ashwaghanda--or it's residual effects--to leave your system.if you're still considering rolling the dice to receive some of the benefits ashwagandha can provide, please see your doctor first or consider trying a different supplement. also try a quick keyword search for the word ""itch"" in the reviews for this product. you'll hear similar horror stories. you've been warned.  :)",Allergic

"compare to centrum & centrum knockoff ..... this solimo 50+ daily vitamin is certainly a value-for-the-money item. with plenty of doses (125 tablets) for just under $5, you really cannot beat that cost. however, compare it to my bargain-brand centrum knockoff, which has 100 tablets for about the same cost, and there is more percentage of the vitamins/minerals in most of the types, and i receive just a few less per bottle. as well, compare it to centrum silver, which is roughly twice as much, but you have that trusted name, and more vitamins/minerals as well in the centrum.while i’m not sure that more percentage of vitamins/minerals matters—what we don’t need we release from our bodies unused—if you want more percentages, and as well if you want iron (there’s no iron in these solimo), then you may want to compare brands as well and make a choice that fits you and fits your budget.i will take these solimo, but likely will return to the centrum knockoff i’ve been taking for quite some time now—the prices are around the same (with solimo maybe a little cheaper), but i’ll be receiving a little more bang for my buck.however, solimo brand has no weird taste or weird odor to it, so that’s a good thing.  what it also has going for it is: no artificial flavors, no gluten (if that matters to you and it doesn’t to me), and no lactose. that would make me take a second look at perhaps crossing over to the solimo for the no artificial flavors and no lactose. i’m still on the fence and deciding.it’s really not possible to know exactly what’s happening to my body on a cellular level with vitamins/minerals i take, or to know any real difference between the solimo and the brand i am taking—it’s unlikely i will feel any difference in my body and energy, etc—so, i have to go on the smaller details.all in all not a bad vitamin. compare what’s in it with your usual multi and see what fits your own needs.",Quality/Contaminated

"not a good monster replacement. i was excited to find a possible replacement for expensive monster drinks.  here are my findings after one case (solimno red).1) cans are weak, very cheap packaging. on day 1, as i pulled off the plastic wrap, one of the cans popped a pin hole and sprayed my entire office before i could get a trash can over it.  down to 23 cans on the first day. savings are now very minimal. (it stains)  do not knock these cans around. very thin can walls and crappy opener tabs.2) flavor is not good at all.  the various calorie free monster drinks have sharp and clean flavors with no after taste.  the solimo red tastes like artificial sweetener, and it leaves a long lasting after taste that is unpleasant.3) price is good.  basically 32 ounces for free compared to monster purple.4) the decision maker for me was the caffeine effect.  monster cans spread the energy rise/rush out over two hours.  solimno red hits you hard all at once and burns down quickly.  caffeine flush is guaranteed if you drink one fast.  for people who use a monster to manage shift work disorder, this is not for you. slow sipping a monster over an hour will be way more effective, leaving you less jittery.i will not be purchasing this again.  spend the extra $4 for a monster purple or orange.",Quality/Contaminated

"natures made prenatal gummies-sweet vitamin treat. nature made prenatal gummies are a supplemental gummy that are designed to provide extra vitamins to mom and growing baby all while being a sweet treat.  nature made prenatal gummies contains 7 grams of carbohydrates and 5 grams of sugar per two gummies. they may not be suitable for those on a low-carb low-sugar diet.  they have a sugary coating and are sweetened with sugar, glucose sugar, and sucrose.  my preference would be that they were sweetened with a healthy sugar substitute like stevia.  nature made prenatal gummies are unique because they contain a small amount of dha and epa. they are a rather large gummy and have a raspberry type of flavor.  the flavor is decent but it took me a bit to get used to the sweetness.  this gummy was easy on my stomach and was good as an after dinner treat.  this would be a good gummy for someone who gets daily sweet cravings.  i find that i could go without the sugar coating and that they would likely still be enjoyable all while being healthier. they also are missing a few of the recommended vitamins for pregnancy. those additional vitamins can be supplemented. this is a very basic formula that can be used as a supplementation to a woman's daily diet.  it is good for women who have had trouble with prenatals as it is not hard on the stomach.",Bad Taste/Flavor
